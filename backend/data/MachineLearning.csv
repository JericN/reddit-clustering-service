I am curious how the images generated by our prompts are compared against the images generated by the game.

1. are they using simple NLP techniques to compare similarity of the prompts?

We’re excited to share our recent work on Neural Architecture Search (NAS) search spaces.

**Introducing einspace**: a flexible and comprehensive search space that integrates convolutional networks (convnets), transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs).

Our approach breaks down architectures into four key components:
1. **MLP**
2. **Branch**
3. **Aggregate**
4. **Route**

These components form the 'RGB' genes of architectural design. Our goal is to balance granularity, avoiding the redundancy of reinventing linear layers while maintaining flexibility across different models.

We’d love for you to explore our work and see how we approach architectural exploration. Your feedback and thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

So it says:

I do follow the math derivation, but **intuitively** I do not understand why:

  
1. co-parents is part of Markov blanket?

2.  why isn't parents of co-parents part of Markov blanket?  that is, why would information stop at co-parent, not one-level up to parents of the co-parent?

for the past weeks, we’ve been developing an open-source evaluation and testing framework for computer vision models. Today we’ve released the first alpha version and would love to get your feedback and support.

Github: [https://github.com/moonwatcher-ai/moonwatcher](https://github.com/moonwatcher-ai/moonwatcher)

**What problems are we solving?**

* **Manual, error-prone evaluation:** Assessing model quality is still a manual and error-prone process. Of course, aggregation metrics exist, but they usually overlook that the model works differently on some parts of the data.
* **Lack of a single source of truth:** Teams struggle to align on AI quality. There are multiple metrics and not all stakeholders understand their meaning and implication. Moreover, manual evaluations from different model versions are stored in Notion, Jira, Google Docs et al which makes it difficult to find reliable data about model quality.
* **Testing for compliance:** The AI Act is coming into force in the next months. Becoming compliant requires teams to fully understand the capacities and limitations of their models and document them. One way of doing that is through testing. BY THE WAY: Some companies out there charge an between 100k-300k for a certification. We believe that there needs to be an open-source alternative that ensures a vibrant ecosystem which can release innovative products without paying a fortune.

**Features**

**Open-Source Package** 🌝

* **Automated Checks:** There is a set of automated checks that you can run. For now, we’ve started with image features such as brightness and saturation. In the future, we plan to develop more complex automation checks based on image content, bounding box size etc.
* **Customizable Checks:** Of course you can write your own custom checks.
* **Quick Demos:** We’ve set up demos that help you understand how it all works.

**Web App**

* **Visualize Results:** You can visualize the test results and browse relevant images to debug failure cases. In the future, we want to allow non-technical team members to use the app to create tests and align on model results.
* **Share Insights:** Non-devs are used to using non-dev tools. We believe that it’s important to establish a common ground where engineers and non-technical stakeholders can communicate to foster a common understanding of model quality.

Transformer blocks basically enrich V (value) vectors with context after each block.

In my case I have Q =/= K =/= V, and while mathematically fine, I haven't come across an application that did this. 

I want a behavior that when K = Q, then V_new = Transformer (Q, K, V) = V, since Q matches K. With usual scaled-dot attention this is not case, but i guess this could be overcomed by the other components such as the MLPs.

My questions are then:
1. Is there a modified attention (other that computationally expensive distance matrix) attention that can return V when K=Q
2. When K=V, then it's trivial how to apply transformer blocks repeatedly since `V_new = Transformer(Q, V, V)` at every time step. But if `K=/=V`, after `V_new = Transformer(Q,K,V)` it is not clear if I should do `V_new_new = Transformer(Q,K, V_new)`

(or am I wrong?),"I'm working on a research project that aims at applying next-token-prediction models to build/improve recommender systems. As a feasibility assessment study, I built and trained a GPT model to predict the next product to buy using the Instacart dataset. To be more specific, I treated each product\_id as a ""word"", each order as a ""sentence"" and each user's transaction history as a ""document"".

However, after 4 hours of training on a T4 GPU, the mean average precision at 10 (MAP@10) on the eval set is still only 0.075. For comparison, MAP@10 for the baseline popular product (top 10 most popular products in the user's personal transaction history) is already 0.251.

Although I can see one or two ways to improve the model, the low performance compared to a very simple baseline is really discouraging and makes me think this approach is not feasible at all. I would like to discuss a few points:

1. Is it true that next-token prediction (specifically decoder-only transformer architectures) doesn't work for this problem at any scale?
- Support: There are a lot of differences between the text data and the e-commerce transaction data, so a method that works for text might not work for transactions, it's no surprise.
- Against: 4 hours of training is only 1.5 epochs, so the current model may be underfitted. Therefore, the low performance could just be a function of training time and it might improve if I train for 2 days

2. Any resources I should read into this? I'm aware that the approach I'm taking is similar to session-based recsys models, but I only found one paper HierTCN (You et al., WWW 2019). Would appreciate any additional suggestions to read into this.

3. Any suggestion to help train the model better/faster? The current configuration is:
- Data: vocab\_size = 50000 (50K products), 200K users (each epoch is 200K training examples)
- Model: n\_layer=9, d\_model=512, n\_head=16 (similar to Gopher 44M-parameter model), block\_size=1024

Machine Learning is an expansive field, deeply intertwined with numerous other disciplines. My master's degree alone covers topics such as statistics, optimization, inverse data simulation, MLOps, software engineering, agent-based modeling, semantic web, deep learning, time series... Each of these areas has its own subfields that one could dedicate their entire lifetime to explore.

I have come to realize that unless you practice a subject daily, the knowledge you acquire from books, certifications, articles, papers, podcasts, and videos on a topic will eventually fade away. This realization led me to discover Obsidian four years ago, which has significantly changed how I consume and retain information. I now take notes on everything I consume, especially on topics that interest me outside of my job. Much like a ""second brain"". Without this practice, I find that the information quickly slips away.

Indeed, I have spent countless hours engaging with content on physics, history, epistemology, philosophy, and many other subjects. However, only a fraction of what I once knew has endured. This brings me to a dilemma: should I invest a substantial amount of time capturing every resource in my knowledge system ensuring that I can carry it over time, or consume resources as quickly as they'll fade away ()""for fun"" or when my time is limited)?

I don't want to make this post overly long, but I genuinely feel the benefits of spending time processing information when reading a book, for example. Organizing and connecting knowledge at scale is often challenging but also rewarding, as it helps build a deep understanding of a subject. Additionally, when you need to refresh your memory, the ""cost"" is much lower if you have already done this ""pre-processing"" work rather than going over the internet / books again. I'm not simply copy/pasting text, but tailoring what I capture depending on what I already know about a subject.

However, there is so much to learn in this field, even the fundamentals like mathematics or statistics. I sometimes question whether this approach is sustainable. For instance, the book ""Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn"" by Sebastian Raschka and others is 700 pages long. Imagine the time it takes to capture every piece of information from such a comprehensive book (and that's only one!). Taking notes also forces you to understand the material thoroughly, including every equation, or else the notes are useless.

I'm not advocating for a binary approach; I often find compromises. But I am curious about your approach to learning and consuming information. How do you balance the need to retain knowledge with the practical constraints of time and effort?",12,53

Graph theorist Diestel has written a book addressing the ML community (and others):  


Tangles: A structural approach to artificial intelligence in the empirical sciences  
Reinhard Diestel, Cambridge University Press 2024  


\-----

Publisher's blurb:  


Tangles offer a precise way to identify structure in imprecise data. By grouping qualities that often occur together, they not only reveal clusters of things but also types of their qualities: types of political views, of texts, of health conditions, or of proteins. Tangles offer a new, structural, approach to artificial intelligence that can help us understand, classify, and predict complex phenomena.  


This has become possible by the recent axiomatization of the mathematical theory of tangles, which has made it applicable far beyond its origin in graph theory: from clustering in data science and machine learning to predicting customer behaviour in economics; from DNA sequencing and drug development to text and image analysis.  


Such applications are explored here for the first time. Assuming only basic undergraduate mathematics, the theory of tangles and its potential implications are made accessible to scientists, computer scientists and social scientists. 

\-----

Ebook, plus open-source software including tutorials, can be found on tangles-book.com.  


Note: This is an 'outreach' book not primarily about tangle theory, but about applying tangles in a multitude of unexpected ways and areas. Tangles in graphs are covered in Diestel's Graph Theory, 5th ed'n.  


Table of Contents and an introduction for data scientists (Ch.1.2), are available from tangles-book.com/book/details/ and from arXiv:2006.01830. Chapters 6 and 14 are about a new method of soft clustering based on tangles, very different from traditional methods. Chapters 7-9 cover the theory needed for Chapter 14.  


The software part of tangles-book.com say they invite collaboration on concrete projects, as well as contributions to their GitHub software library.

# LLM Merging Competition: Building LLMs Efficiently through Merging

*NeurIPS 2024 Challenge*

## Aims and Focus

Training high-performing large language models (LLMs) from scratch is a notoriously expensive and difficult task, costing hundreds of millions of dollars in compute alone. These pretrained LLMs, however, can cheaply and easily be adapted to new tasks via fine-tuning, leading to a proliferation of models that suit specific use cases. Recent work has shown that specialized fine-tuned models can be rapidly **merged** to combine capabilities and generalize to new skills.

## Get started

The competition will provide the participants with a list of expert models that have already been trained on a task-specific dataset. All of these models will be publicly available on the Hugging Face Model Hub with licenses that permit their use for research purposes. These models can either be fully fine-tuned models or models obtained by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. Models on this list will be required to satisfy the following criteria: (1) model size <= 8B parameters, and (2) model with licenses compatible with research use (e.b., MIT, Apache 2 etc).

I has implement Independent Q Learning using DQN (Deep Q Network) for each agent in [Cooperative Pong](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/butterfly/cooperative_pong/) env in PettingZoo. Now i am reading about [VDN ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05296)(Value Decompose Network) and i have a question.  
In this paper, they said that the join value Q function is sum of sub Q function of each agent. The idea is to maximize local Q function of each agent which equivalent to maximize global Q function. But the IQL is also maximize to local Q function of each agent to. So what is the different between two these ?

**Prompt: Does the following sentence contain apples or oranges:** Examples:

2. Would it be better to use a sentence transformer and do classification?

It got me thinking about the feasibility of implementing similar interpretability techniques for open-source language models. Can we steer LLMs and their behaviour without having to extensively finetune.

I wanted to reach out to this community to discuss a few things:

1. Has anyone already implemented or experimented with similar interpretability techniques on open-source language models? Can we make something similar to that of golden gate claude??
2. Do you think it's feasible to adapt and scale these techniques to work with Llama,phi,mistral etc. These are much smaller in parameters size, when compared to sonnet.
3. I'm interested in collaborating with others who are passionate about this area of research.

The summary is: create a virtual biome where every agent has a ""DNA"" representing the structure of its neural network, with the capacity of reproduction with other agents.

I already created an example on GitHub of the DeepDNA, where two DNAs are created and then merged to generate a child's DNA.

I'm looking for collaborators to develop efficiently the theory (and the implementation) and that can help me to solve some conceptual bottlenecks, like the training of an agent model or the structure of the sequences in case of complex layers like LSTM.

I appreciate the collaboration with a university and the ambition to publish the paper as a research.

I am quite proficient with python (as expected) but beside that, I have only very rudimentary knowledge of javascript and C++. I want to learn a second language that is more ""low level"" and can leverage the hardware features better. My goal is not to rewrite pytorch or replace python entirely (although [porting the inference to mojo may make sense](https://github.com/tairov/llama2.mojo)), but provide alternatives for performance critical use cases.

Looking at today's situation, the obvious answer is C++. However, Rust has been gaining popularity and besides the steep learning curve, people are starting to put it above C++ in many aspects. In both cases, the syntax and languages are not very close to python, which makes them difficult to learn. Mojo seems much better in this respect, providing both low level features where the syntax somehow resembles Rust (at least for a layman like me) but also can be used as weird python flavour. It even allows importing python libraries directly. This is very helpful for such a young language, where a large community and a variety of libraries are missing. Nevertheless, the language is still young and very much subject to change so I am not sure if I should invest.

So what do you think is the best ""second"" language for the use cases above? Any experience with Mojo? How did you learn it or any other language with a limited number of resources. I am planning to read through the docs and solve last years advent of code using it if I go with Mojo.",87,53

Recently, Lin et al. (2024) proposed URIAL, a method using only three in-context examples to align base LLMs, achieving non-trivial instruction following performance. In this work, we show that, while effective, ICL alignment with URIAL still underperforms compared to instruction fine-tuning on established benchmarks such as MT-Bench and AlpacaEval 2.0 (LC), especially with more capable base LMs. Unlike for tasks such as classification, translation, or summarization, adding more ICL demonstrations for long-context LLMs does not systematically improve instruction following performance. To address this limitation, we derive a greedy selection approach for ICL examples that noticeably improves performance, yet without bridging the gap to instruction fine-tuning. Finally, we provide a series of ablation studies to better understand the reasons behind the remaining gap, and we show how some aspects of ICL depart from the existing knowledge and are specific to the instruction tuning setting. Overall, our work advances the understanding of ICL as an alignment technique.",1,2

1. Constrain the search space when training LoRAs

LoRAs and other adapter methods allow us to cut down on needed trainable parameters by a lot, but we may be able to cut down much much further if we have a prior over the kind of results we want. Additionally, LoRAs and similar are just small enough that we can train models on them.

https://preview.redd.it/cn4m3ql6tv3d1.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=b203c7c48090d55a1d15c508119466c874e1c2cb

The main methods that had interesting results were directly training a diffusion model to generate LoRAs and training learnable coefficients to mix LoRAs either globally or per-layer, similar to work by [sakana.ai](http://sakana.ai) with evolutionary model-merging.

https://preview.redd.it/goh703gguv3d1.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=b06172f7800eecabd120b324cc090fe54b12624e

For experimentation, I created a dataset of 136 LoRAs trained on different celebrities (something I could hope to be a reasonably low dimensional manifold) each of 1.3M parameters for Stable Diffusion. Only requiring an at-home 3090.

The dataset is first prepared by fusing all LoRAs into full weight matrices, then decomposing again using singular value decomposition to ensure consistent representations and get rid of an unnecessary symmetry while modeling.

Because 136 datapoints does not get you very far, and with the knowledge that merging LoRAs also generally results in something that quacks like an in-distribution LoRA, I used sets of augmentations revolving around randomly creating merges on the fly and adding small amounts of noise.

For the learnable merging method, we keep all of our pretrained LoRAs in memory and learned weighted coefficients of their outputs, thus all of the unique celebrities create the basis vectors of the space of possible results.

I first tried a layer-wise weighting method resulting in only 14k trainable parameters and then trained on images of my face. There is decent consistency

https://preview.redd.it/ghl03mb0yv3d1.png?width=1406&format=png&auto=webp&s=b355307a0d1a4c60ea8a269761649f803ce25eb5

Then I tried a global weighting, resulting only in as many trainable parameters as there are LoRAs, 136. It's much looser this time and a bit inconsistent but its pretty interesting considering how few parameters. I think the results could be better if we could ensure our basis LoRAs were maximally unique or somehow better covered the space we want to train over

While the GAN and VAE methods did not work so well, the diffusion method really went beyond my expectations. My best guess is that noise added during training and in the generative process might act as an augmentation in itself. It's capable of generating a very diverse range of people (although they generally have this subjective celebrity look to them that is difficult to escape)

I suspect this method could be made conditional as well, using image embeddings to guide the generation potentially.

I'm reading through ""Tuning Playbook"" and I'm having some trouble understanding the concept of ***exploration vs exploitation*** in the context of hyperparameter tuning.

Is there anyone who can explain this concept in a more concrete manner rather being abstract, or maybe provide an example of how exploration is conducted in hyperparameter tuning?  what is exploration and how it will conducted. and one more thing; it keeps saying **understanding the problem,** which problem? the problem model tries to solve? or the problem of what hyperparameter influence the performance and each other? or what?

Especially for for multilingual,"\[My first post here, a better place for this, in some LLM subreddit? It was removed, until I added \[D\], \[R\] better for my sort of research?\]

The tokenizer (tiktoken) for gpt-4o is seemingly adding tokens (at least for Icelandic), since gpt-4, and I believe it's going in the opposite direction we should be going. I don't think it's sustainable, nor needed, to expand that way to more natural languages. Even Icelandic alone has over 1 million word \*forms\* (e.g. all adjectives come in 120 word forms) and counting (in incomplete database of words I have), and English has over 400 thousand words.

It occurred to me, tokens should just be one letter (or even part of). I've since changed my mind and I think tokens should be based on bigrams (plus single letter tokens/bytes). Numbers and punctuation, and space, must be a special case, and Chinese. \[Tokens could in theory be only two the bits 0 and 1, and 8 needed to make up bytes..., why not, the answer might be the same as for why not single byte tokens.\]

The average length of a word is around 10 letters, in English, and German etc. i.e. from dictionaries, but in actual use the average length of an English word is ""4.79 letters per word, and 80% are between 2 and 7 letters long"" so basing on bigraphs, would mean a factor of 2-3 times more tokens per word, for a very modest expansion. I hear you say, we pay per token, but costs are coming down, and with linear transformers, or similar Mamba etc., do no longer have the quadratic cost of traditional Transformers, nor effectively limited context lengths/windows, also the output of tokens is very fast.

So why bigrams, not trigrams, or base only on single letters (5x more tokens), or only on whole words (without subwords, or allow that too?)?

Basing on only letters could mean 26 possible lower case tokens, double for upper case, or 128 possible for full ASCII, or over one million possible tokens for full Unicode support.

Clearly basing on Unicode code points (rather than code units, maybe) seems not viable, even if we have tokens for so far only the about 150 thousand assigned characters. It might be doable, tokens, i.e. ""vocabulary"" count is already about a third of that.

Tokenizers already have ""byte"" tokens (to handle arbitrary Unicode, but a recent addition?), meaning any arbitrary binary file, or UTF-8 file, is possible, already, it's like an escape hatch when a word can't be tokenized as one, or more (for sub-word tokens). So why not only base on bytes, 256 possible tokens (plus some few control tokens)? I believe the reason it's not already done, is that, in effect it mean the network needs to learn the UTF-8 encoding, i.e. to decode variable 1 to 4 bytes per letter (I'm sure possible, but we might not want to vast part of it, I think lowest layers, on such decoding; Image neural neural networks can already decode binary file formats, not just PNG, even compressed JPEG, to some degree, I suppose only handling DC coefficients, i.e. at lower resolution, not discovering DCT).

Non single-letter tokens handicap an LLM in some situations. E.g. if you ask it: how many letters are in the word ""transformers""? To us we count letters, but the LLM sees the whole word as one token, so it must somehow store the number of letters for that, and each token, and have a way to decode them. This could lead to a problem in all kinds of unusual situations. The argument could be the simplest model one-letter tokens, best, or the next-simplest bigrams. So why not the simplest? It allows for arbitrary text such as a random password 8irkQPbIsYqqVFb. But it is not semantically meaningful. We want mostly to compress meaningful data/language, i.e. non-random data (random isn't compressible). Current tokenizers are very good at it, but bigrams are also good. English has 26 letter alphabet, and arbitrary bigrams would be 26\^2 = 676 possibilities, and trigrams 26\^3 = 17576, while English actually has only 139 bigrams (79% compression), and way more trigrams (somewhat better compression, but I think trigrams not scalable to many languages).

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2334](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2334)

Russian/Cyrillic has its own 132 bigrams, the number of tokens possible will be 139 (for English) + 132 = 271 at a minimum (see table 6). German has 151 so the numbers add up to many, though even German, French etc. bigrams have some overlap with English. E.g. Indic languages will not, maybe with each other. Chinese has whole words in each letter, so bigrams do not apply in the same way, likely need to be special-cased, handled more like punctuation, each with it's own token, and Chinese alone will have a lot.

Using bigrams has a certain simplicity, e.g. counting letters in a word is simple for even-number-letter words, and only one special case other words. Odd-number-letter words must store only letter in a special way. The last letter in a word could be that possible odd letter. It's simple to do and I'm unsure if the alternative, i.e. having the first letter the possible odd- letter would be any better (then you must first count them), I still want the first letter handled in a special way anyway for casing purposes.

At first it seemed to get me the exact same tokens, just many tokens renumbered, but actually it seems like it's ""improving"" for Icelandic, supposedly, with now one fewer:

The ""einn"" there is the masculine form (for ""alone""), and ""ein"" the female, then the old one adds an ""n"", and it seems ok. I it works either way, Icelandic isn't perfect yet, but close enough (also the voice capability), which is rather amazing for a very low-resource language, maybe with least training data a very small fraction of a percentage. The split into tokens is grammatically all wrong, so maybe letter split or simple digram would be ok. I think since einn and ein are related words, actually the ein-n might be better with the former token for masculine would then relatable to the female word. However I think we can not rely on such good relevant grammatical split, e.g. heimi-num would be better with -num there the definite article of the word ""world"".",6,8

I want to train a small transformer language model from scratch and I'm trying to squeeze out as much training efficiency as reasonably possible. I was thinking about how to build the training batches which brought me to this paper [EFFICIENT SEQUENCE PACKING WITHOUT CROSS-CONTAMINATION: ACCELERATING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITHOUT IMPACTING PERFORMANCE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02027) which seems like a totally reasonable thing that should just be done in general.

In short, the idea is to pack multiple sequences together in a sample sequence and adjust the attention matrix such that the samples don't cross-contaminate each other, i.e. only attend to tokens within themselves. [This post in the Huggingface forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/the-correct-attention-mask-for-examples-packing/52909) nicely illustrates this. But I couldn't find such thing in Huggingface transformers. Am I missing something? Have other frameworks implemented this? Do we know if the big players are doing the sequence packing? Are there major downsides to this I'm missing? I thought it could become problematic with the positional encodings maybe.

Edit: Huggingface transformers actually supports this, see [https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/27539](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/27539)",8,8

My understanding is that it provides a solution on how to stack multiple layers of GAMs (Generalized Additive Model): The Phi function is just the shape function of a GAM, and splines are well studied shape functions in GAMS.

So to me:

- MLP is a multi-layer linear regression  
- KAN is a multi-layer GAM

Still, a GAM has a link function than is not expressed in the KAN paper, but to me it looks like this is the real point of the paper. If we add an activation function to a KAN layer, then we fully have a multi-layer GAM.

This also means that we can consider MLP as a special case of a KAN because linear-regression is a special case of a GAM.

According to [Roger Grosse](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/introspection-in-ai/) the field has moved away from introspection due to what he views as an aversion to thinking about algorithms in terms of mental states.

  
However, this week we released a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drlqCc_e_o0) that goes over these basic ideas and explores two papers on the concept of introspection that have been released over the past few years.  The first being ""[Introspective CNN's](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/11b921ef080f7736089c757404650e40-Paper.pdf) that  improves classification results by synthesizing samples from its own classifier (as opposed to a GAN which uses a separate discriminator network to generate samples).  This is why the approach is called ""introspective"" because it uses its own classifier.

The [second paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13710#:~:text=27%20Sep%202022%5D-,Towards%20Human%2DCompatible%20XAI%3A%20Explaining%20Data%20Differentials%20with,Concept%20Induction%20over%20Background%20Knowledge&text=Concept%20induction%2C%20which%20is%20based,base%20data%20(ABox)%20graph) uses concept induction to create a set of concepts to describe why a system made a classification decision for the user.  Here the evaluation focused on the human's understanding of the explanation, as opposed to using it to make the classification result better.  This actually relates to an [earlier video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26tTT8saaDs&t=2517s) we released with Prof. [Joao Leite](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ReF98QcAAAAJ&hl=en) where he discussed his results using ""mapping neural networks"" to perform a determination of concepts as well (you can also see [his paper](https://userweb.fct.unl.pt/~jleite/papers/aaai21.pdf)).

Essentially, using data drift as a proxy for performance monitoring is not a great idea.

  
I wanted to prove that by giving data drift methods a second chance and trying to get the most out of them. I built a technique that relies on drift signals to estimate model performance and compared its results against the current SoTA performance estimation methods ([PAPE \[arxiv link\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08348) and [CBPE \[docs link\]](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/performance_estimation.html#confidence-based-performance-estimation-cbpe)) to see which technique performs best.

  
To effectively compare data drift signals against performance estimation methods, I used an evaluation framework that emulates a typical production ML model and ran multiple dataset-model experiments.

As per data, I used datasets from the [Folktables package](https://github.com/socialfoundations/folktables). (Folktables preprocesses US census data to create a set of binary classification problems.) To make sure the results are not biased, in terms of the nature of the model, I trained different types of models (Linear, Ensemble Boosting) for multiple prediction tasks included in Folktables.

Then, I built a technique that relies on drift signals to estimate model performance. This method uses univariate and multivariate data drift information as features of a DriftSignal model to estimate the performance of the model we monitor. It works as follows:

1. Fit univariate/multivariate drift detection calculator on reference data (test set).

1. Take the fitted calculators to measure the observed drift in the production set. For univariate drift detection methods, we use Jensen Shannon, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Chi2 distance metrics/tests. Meanwhile, we use the [PCA Reconstruction Error](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/multivariate_drift.html#data-reconstruction-with-pca) and [Domain Classifier](https://nannyml.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how_it_works/multivariate_drift.html#domain-classifier) for multivariate methods.

1. Build a DriftSignal model that trains a regression algorithm using the drift results from the reference period as features and the monitored model performance as a target.

1. Estimate the performance of the monitored model on the production set using the trained DriftSignal model.

You can find the full implementation of this method in this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/santiviquez/aa224c6e232c8bd2534893888981564d).

  
Then, for evaluation, I used a modified version of MAE because I needed an aggregated version that take into consideration the standard deviation of the errors. To account for this, I scale absolute/squared errors by the standard error (SE) calculated for each evaluation case. We call the SE-scaled metrics **mean absolute standard error (MASTE)**.

[MASTE formula](https://preview.redd.it/7jnk40il2l3d1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=19679d6a202b2175f75c6f3252430792682090ad)

  
Then it was a matter of running all the 580 experiments and collect results.

Since, each performance estimation method is trying to estimate the roc\_auc of the monitored model, I report the MASTE between the estimated and realized roc\_auc.

https://preview.redd.it/z0oviz763l3d1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0e4838dcadbf664ff59570997f46612002c7e6e

PAPE seems to be the most accurate method, followed by CBPE. Surprisingly, constant test set performance is the third best. This is closely followed by random forest versions of univariate and multivariate drift signal models.

  
This plot shows the quality of performance estimation among different methods, including PAPE and CBPE.

Here is a specific time series plot of a model's realized ROC AUC (black) compared against all the performance estimation methods. PAPE (red) accurately estimates the direction of the most significant performance change and closely approximates the magnitude.

The experiments suggest that there are better tools for detecting performance degradation than data drift, even though I tried my best to extract all the meaningful information from drift signals to create an accurate performance estimation method.

There are better tools for quantifying the impact of data drift on model performance. So, I hope this helps the industry realize that monitoring fine-grained metrics leads to nothing and that a change in an obscure feature might not mean anything. It is better to first estimate model performance and then, if it drops, review data drift results but not the other way around.

1. WorkArena [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07718](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07718)
2. WebLinx [https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/weblinx/](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/weblinx/)

But both of these are very small datasets.

They also include telemetry but we believe that we can train LAMs with only video recordings (like how a human can watch a YouTube tutorial and recreate the action on their device). This seems like Tesla's self driving on video rather than needing LiDAR)

What we need help with is defining the 1 million actions in this dataset. It should be a representative dataset across all the ways a human can use a computer. What would you like this dataset to contain that would enable you to use it / work on LAM research ?

**Focus Areas**: I will be working on large language models (LLMs), specifically Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs.

Given this context, I'm looking for any tips or advice on how I can effectively contribute to the research projects, especially given my limited experience.

One of the most well-known examples likely is the [Doomsday algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule).

### What I would like to do:

1) For day of the week calulation: ""Re-discover"" formulas like in [this section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule#Why_it_works). Ideally, discover new such formulas.

2) Sunrise calculation: For this one, I would like to find an (approximation) algorithm that is suitable for mental calculation, while being of by some margin, say, 20 minutes.

I would like to do both by generating a bunch of data and throwing cpu/gpu cycles at it.

### What I have tried to far:

* Symbolic Regression

  * Tried: [FeynmannAI](https://github.com/SJ001/AI-Feynman), [PySR](https://github.com/MilesCranmer/PySR)

  * I like the generated formulas, but unfortunately they are contain float coefficients, while I need integer coefficients (calculations involving floats are hard to do mentally)

* Genetic Programming

  * Tried: [DEAP](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)

  * I like that I can constrain the generated formulas much more (i.e. by only including integer terminals), but I find it quite hard to get good formulas by playing around with the genetic parameters (population, kind of mutation, kind of crossover etc.)

### Questions

A) Are there symbolic regression programs that do not produce formulas with floats in them?

B) Regarding Genetic Programming: Is this the right approach for 1) and 2)? Should I just try harder and learn more about parameter tweaking?

C) Are there other approaches I can try?

","Hi,

Imagine have two classes of JSON, eg, a person and the books they have read, and a set of movies to be watched. Imagine you have a function (can just be labelled data), that says person A will like movie B.  
How would you use this source of labelled data to train some kind of embeddings such that you can dot-product(embeddings(person). embeddings2(movie)) and get a close approximation of if you were able to brute force apply the function (or ask an oracle) for every movie.

In the text world, this is easy, you just pick your favorite sentence embeddings, minHasH, etc, etc. What I am asking here is how would you architect and train a model to produce embeddings for these things that are highly structured.

The ""difficulty"" here is that the two objects inter-relation ship will be complex, and that complexity has to be factored into the two embeddings. In the persons books to movies case, one would assume there's some common latent variables that can be learnt (e.g. genre, style, era), and that the embeddings on both sides would infer something similar, but the embedding function of list of books will be different from that of the embedding function of an individual movie.

A cursory google search just returns adomitions of ""turn your json to text and use text embeddings"".

But we are facing challenges.,"1. Every ML team needs to find an end-to-end solution. Kubeflow is becoming the de facto first choice in the open-source community. It is one of the most comprehensive solutions, with many integrations and completely open-source components. However, its installation requires a strong understanding of various aspects, as it must be installed on a Kubernetes infrastructure. The research and operating costs for a company are very high, often necessitating a dedicated DevOps employee for this task. Additionally, user management is not provided within the solution and needs to be integrated separately.

2. Cloud-managed Kubernetes services like EKS or AKS allow the creation of new Kubernetes clusters but restrict the addition of external nodes. Given the need for ML teams to manage budgets efficiently, particularly with the high cost and shortage of GPUs, it is crucial to have the option of creating a multi-cloud cluster of GPU nodes. The current official solutions involve creating a Kubernetes cluster in each cloud provider and implementing a federation system. This approach is extremely complex to maintain and is not feasible if a provider does not offer a Kubernetes service.

We present a reproducible benchmark comparing different foundation time series models across a wide variety of models in a large scale dataset.

We conclude that [TimeGPT-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03589b) ranks first in terms of accuracy and speed inference compared to the latest foundation models, including [TimesFM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10688) (Google), [Chronos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815) (Amazon), [Moirai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02592) (SalesForece), and [Lag-LLama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08278) (Service Now). TimeGPT-1 and TimesFM also outperform established statistical, machine learning, and deep-learning models, with comparable inference times to a SeasonalNaive. Chronos, Moirai and Lag-Llama still need some further improvements and can be outperformed by other classical methods.

This analysis spans over **30,000 unique time series** across various domains and frequencies from M-Competitions, Monash Repository, and Wikipedia page views, among others, robustly comparing these models.

# Empirical Evaluation

This study considers **over 30,000 unique time series** from the Monash Repository, M-Competitions, Wikipedia page views, among others, spanning various time series frequencies: Monthly, Weekly, Daily, and Hourly. Our evaluation compares five foundation models for time series data in terms of accuracy and inference times. We have also included comparisons to a large battery of statistical, machine learning, and deep-learning models, to provide a benchmark against traditional forecasting methods.

We include the following models in our comprehensive evaluation:

* [Statistical](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast/): SeasonalNaive, HistoricAverage, ZeroModel, AutoARIMA, Prophet, AutoCES, AutoETS, Theta, DynamicOptimizedTheta, ADIDA, IMAPA, and CrostonClassic.
* [Machine Learning](https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast/): AutoLGBM.
* [Deep Learning](https://github.com/Nixtla/neuralforecast/): AutoTFT, AutoNHITS.
* Foundation: Chronos, Lag-Llama, Moirai, TimeGPT, TimeGPT (long horizon), and TimesFM.

# Results

TimeGPT-1 ranks first in terms of accuracy and speed inference compared to the latest foundation models, including TimesFM, Chronos, Moirai, and Lag-Llama. TimesFM by Google ranks second in accuracy and outperfoms TimeGPT-1 in inference speed. Amazon Chronos ranks third in accuracy but shows a significant drop in inference speed. Both Salesforces's and ServiceNow's models are far more efficient in terms of inference speed than Chronos, but they rank lower in terms of accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly complex problems. Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the ""why"" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of ""how"", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area.

This study empirically investigates claims of the increasing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI) within roughly 80 million research publications across 20 diverse scientific fields, by examining the change in scholarly engagement with AI from 1985 through 2022. We observe exponential growth, with AI-engaged publications increasing approximately thirteenfold (13x) across all fields, suggesting a dramatic shift from niche to mainstream. Moreover, we provide the first empirical examination of the distribution of AI-engaged publications across publication venues within individual fields, with results that reveal a broadening of AI engagement within disciplines. While this broadening engagement suggests a move toward greater disciplinary integration in every field, increased ubiquity is associated with a semantic tension between AI-engaged research and more traditional disciplinary research. Through an analysis of tens of millions of document embeddings, we observe a complex interplay between AI-engaged and non-AI-engaged research within and across fields, suggesting that increasing ubiquity is something of an oil-and-water phenomenon -- AI-engaged work is spreading out over fields, but not mixing well with non-AI-engaged work.",0,5

**Tangles: A structural approach to artificial intelligence in the empirical sciences**

Reinhard Diestel, Cambridge University Press 2024



**Ebook**, plus open-source **software** including tutorials, available from **tangles-book.com.**



Note: This is an 'outreach' book not primarily about tangle theory, but about *applying* tangles in a multitude of unexpected ways and areas. Tangles in graphs are covered in my *Graph Theory*, 5th ed'n.



Table of Contents and an introduction for data scientists (Ch.1.2), are available from tangles-book.com/book/details/ and from [arXiv:2006.01830](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01830). Chapters 6 and 14 are about a new method of soft clustering based on tangles, very different from traditional methods. Chapters 7-9 cover the theory needed for Chapter 14.

  


Collaboration on concrete projects is warmly invited, as are contributions to the GitHub software library.





*Publisher's blurb:*



Tangles offer a precise way to identify structure in imprecise data. By grouping qualities that often occur together, they not only reveal clusters of things but also types of their qualities: types of political views, of texts, of health conditions, or of proteins. Tangles offer a new, structural, approach to artificial intelligence that can help us understand, classify, and predict complex phenomena.



This has become possible by the recent axiomatization of the mathematical theory of tangles, which has made it applicable far beyond its origin in graph theory: from clustering in data science and machine learning to predicting customer behaviour in economics; from DNA sequencing and drug development to text and image analysis.



Such applications are explored here for the first time. Assuming only basic undergraduate mathematics, the theory of tangles and its potential implications are made accessible to scientists, computer scientists and social scientists.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05254v1","This is the first time I have tried to read through a paper. However, I have difficulties understanding this one and thought you guys would know the answer to my question because this new architecture seems like a big deal for LLMs as seen in figure 1.

[Figure 1](https://preview.redd.it/n6iitz36873d1.png?width=804&format=png&auto=webp&s=597102302acd26f27e28e99b366c13b7b135457a)

As I understand it, the main idea is splitting the network into two parts. The first L/2 layers are self-decoder layers which generate a global KV-Cache. The second L/2 layers are cross-decoder layers reusing the generated global KV-Cache.

Quote from their paper on how they save so much computation and memory ( I understand this part ):

>Specifically, because global KV caches are reused and efficient self-attention needs constant caches, the number of caches is O(N + CL), where N is the input length, C is a constant (e.g., sliding window size), and L is the number of layers. For long sequences, CL is much smaller than N, so about O(N) caches are required, i.e., you only cache once. In comparison, Transformer decoders have to store N × L keys and values during inference. So YOCO roughly saves L times GPU memory for caches compared to Transformer decoders.

Here is what I don't get. In a decoder-only network, the concepts of Queries, Keys, and Values function somewhat similarly to their use in a database, but with a focus on capturing relationships between words. In each layer of such a network, these components help refine the understanding of the text, adjusting the focus based on new insights as the processing moves from one layer to the next.

Each layer builds upon the previous ones by updating the queries, keys, and values, which in turn refine the network's interpretation and response generation.

**If all of the information of the individual KV-caches of a decoder only network is now compressed into a global KV-Cache, don't we lose valuable information and shouldn't we see worse performance?**  
  
Additionally, we only have half the layers to refine this interpretation, as the cross-decoder layers all reuse the same KV-cache.

I'm working on forecasting values that are released at 12 PM each day, which include the values for all 24 hours of the following day. Typically, my method involves using an expanding window technique where I train on all available data up to today (released yesterday) and then predict the next day's 24-hour values.

However, complications arise during daylight savings time adjustments. Twice a year, the data shifts due to daylight savings (Europe), resulting in days with either 23 or 25 hours. Most time series libraries handle backtesting by predicting fixed window sizes, but this fixed size doesn't adapt to the hour changes during daylight savings, leading to potential data leakage. For example, in spring, the model drifts by one hour, incorporating data that is technically released a full day after the prediction time.

I see a few potential solutions (from least to most preferred imo):

1. Manipulate the data by adding or removing an hour during the transition days. This could involve inserting a fabricated value or duplicating the preceding hour.

2. Develop a custom backtesting function that can accommodate varying time frequencies (day, week, month) rather than fixed integer size windows.

3. Use a library that already addresses this issue. I can't seem to find a popular library that already has this feature implemented, so please let me know if you know any! I especially have trouble finding an AutoML library that accommodates this.


What are your thoughts on these solutions? Could there be a simpler approach, or am I overthinking it? All suggestions are welcome!",7,6

# Abstract:

Following the recent popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), several attempts have been made to extend them to the visual domain. From having a visual assistant that could guide us through unfamiliar environments to generative models that produce images using only a high-level text description, the vision-language model (VLM) applications will significantly impact our relationship with technology. However, there are many challenges that need to be addressed to improve the reliability of those models. While language is discrete, vision evolves in a much higher dimensional space in which concepts cannot always be easily discretized. To better understand the mechanics behind mapping vision to language, we present this introduction to VLMs which we hope will help anyone who would like to enter the field. First, we introduce what VLMs are, how they work, and how to train them. Then, we present and discuss approaches to evaluate VLMs. Although this work primarily focuses on mapping images to language, we also discuss extending VLMs to videos.",0,4

When comparing various LLMs, one can see that some of them use the same matrix for the token embeddings and the transformation matrix in the end before the softmax is taken to get the predicted token probabilities. I found this paper from 2016 [Using the Output Embedding to Improve Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.05859) which suggests this is superior and also the [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) paper references it and does this weight sharing. Same for other models such as GPT2 and Gemma.

That makes me wonder why the LLaMa models don't do this weight sharing. Is it worth it in terms of model capacity to have separate matrices there? Do models like Gemma necessarily have to use weight sharing because they use a huge vocabulary? I'd be interested in the trade-offs here and what's the current consensus for this topic, if there is any.",11,42

Then I finish the training and get the H5 model.  
Then I tried to convert to TFLite model with Full Integer INT8 quantization.  
(The original example didn't do Full integer quantization, only set as 'Default'.)  
Quantization code is as below.

`def representative_data_gen():`

`for input_value, _ in test_dataset.take(100):`

`yield [input_value]`

`model = load_model('NS_SEGAN_localTrained.h5')`

`model.summary()`

`score = model.evaluate(test_dataset)`

`tflite_model = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)`

`tflite_model.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]`

`tflite_model.representative_dataset = representative_data_gen`

`tflite_model.target_spec.supported_ops = [`

`tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS,`

`tflite_model_quant_INT8 = tflite_model.convert()`

`with open('NS_SEGAN_localTrained_quant_2.tflite', 'wb') as f:`

`f.write(tflite_model_quant_INT8)`

Then it seems strange that only the 1st ""TransposeConv"" operator gets normal dimension,  
others have output dimension as \[1,1,1,1\].

[The first 'TransposeConv' has normal dimension.](https://preview.redd.it/pk3jw2xcj53d1.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=81389faff406296309ca0cc183a1f40a278fe11b)

I was kind of doubt if this is correct, while on the other hand, it's converted by TFLite API, that makes me thinking it should be correct. Someone expert told me it shouldn't be \[1,1,1,1\], but without explain or advice.

I have no idea how to confirm if this is correct or not. If the \[1,1,1,1\] is reasonable in this case?  
Furthermore, if it's wrong, why this happened and how to fix it?  
Please kindly advise or guide if someone has idea or experience.

I have a couple of pytorch models which are being used to validate images, and I want to deploy them to an endpoint. I am using fast api as an API wrapper and I'll go through my dev process so far:

Earlier I was running a plain OOTB inferencing, something like this:

    model = Model()
    
    @app.post('/model/validate/'):
      pred = model.forward(img)
      return {'pred':pred}

The issue with this approach was it was unable to handle concurrent traffic, so requests would get queued and inferencing would happen 1 request at a time, which is something that I wanted to avoid.

My current implementation is as follows: it makes a copy of the model object, and spins off a new thread to process a particular image. somewhat like this:

    model = Model()
    
    def validate(model, img):
      pred = model.forward(img)
      return pred
    
    @app.post('/model/validate/'):
      model_obj = copy.deepcopy(model)
      loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
      pred = await loop.run_in_executor(validate, model_obj, img)
      return {'pred' : pred}

This approach makes a copy of the model object and inferences on the object copy, with which I am able to serve concurrent requests.

My question is, is there another, more optimized way I can achieve pytorch model concurrency, or is this a valid way of doing things?

TLDR: Creating new thread with copy of model object to achieve concurrency, is there any other way to achieve concurrency?",13,9

Wanted to share the latest side hustle that I've been cooking for the past few months. This is a terminal application that runs locally music generation models, right now, only [MusicGen by Meta](https://audiocraft.metademolab.com/musicgen.html) is available.

[https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT](https://github.com/gabotechs/MusicGPT)

It works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without the need for Python or any heavy machine learning framework installed. Instead, it's written entirely in Rust using the ONNX runtime to run the LMs locally in a performant way, even using hardware accelerators like GPUs.

The app works like this:

- It accepts a natural language prompt from the user

- Generates a music sample conditioned by the prompt

- Encodes the generated sample into .wav format and plays it on the device

Additionally, it ships a UI that allows interacting with the AI models in a chat-like web application, storing chat history and generated music on the device.

The vision of the project is that it can eventually generate infinite music streams in real time, for example, an infinite stream of always new LoFi songs for listening while coding, but not quite there yet...

It was an interesting journey getting a transformer based model up and running in a constrained environment in Rust, without PyTorch or TensorFlow, hope you like it!",9,35

I’m currently working on a project involving the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for predicting train delays. The goal is to perform multi-step parallel predictions for each train in the network. One of the main challenges is accounting for the spatial-temporal dimensionality of the problem and the interactions between the trains accross all the railway (See what the network looks like like in the picture). The dataset is made of snapshots of the state of the network (with the current trains) at a given time

I’ve come up with two non mature approaches so far and would appreciate any advice, remarks, or alternatives:

**Approach 1: Heterogeneous Graph Model**

In this approach, I construct a heterogeneous graph with two types of nodes: stations and trains. This results in three types of relationships: train-station, train-train, and station-station. The prediction task is essentially edge prediction, specifically for train-station edges. For a given train, the model aims to predict its links (delays) with its n\_following​ stations.

**Approach 2: Homogeneous Graph Model**

My second approach involves the use of a homogeneous graph where each node represents a Remarkable Point (RP) in the railway network such as a station, junction, etc. Each node has features such as the type of RP, geographic location, and a time-series feature representing the delay of trains at that RP over time. The edges in this graph represent the direct travel path between two RPs, with features such as average travel time and number of trains per day. The output of the GNN is the predicted delay at each RP for the next few time steps.

In the existing litterature, either the model is for one train prediction, or the railway is a made of one line and this is not what i want.

 I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have. Thanks in advance!",4,15

I'm trying to compare my results against the official TREC evaluation script (https://github.com/terrierteam/jtreceval) but am noticing that my implementation is about 20 points higher than it should be.

The function(s) that I'm using are as follows:

```Python
def dcg_score(relevance_scores, k=10):
    dcg = 0
    for idx in range(min(k, len(relevance_scores))):
        rel_i = relevance_scores[idx]
        dcg += (2 ** rel_i - 1) / np.log2(idx + 2)
    return dcg


def ndcg_at_k(retrieved_docs, ground_truth, k=10):
    """"""Compute the nDCG@k for each query.""""""
    ndcg_scores = {}
    for query_id, docs in retrieved_docs.items():
        relevance_scores = [1 if doc_id.docid in ground_truth.get(query_id, []) else 0 for doc_id in docs[:k]]
        dcg_val = dcg(relevance_scores, k)
        ideal_relevance_scores = sorted(relevance_scores, reverse=True)
        idcg_val = dcg(ideal_relevance_scores, k)
        ndcg_scores[query_id] = dcg_val / idcg_val if idcg_val > 0 else 0.0
    return ndcg_scores
```

The MIRACL benchmark doesn't have any provided relevance scores; it just tells you which documents are positive and negative for each query. Hence, I'm using binary relevance scores.

I have a dictionary that maps each query ID to its own positive passage IDs. The relevance scores are obtained by mapping the retrieved documents to 0 or 1 depending on whether they're positive or not.

These relevance scores are first used to calculate the DCG score, and then this is used to calculate the nDCG. The IDCG is calculated by taking the relevance scores and sorting them in descending order.

Can anyone point out what I'm doing wrong? I believe I followed the equations accurately.",5,5

This post serves as an invitation to share your way of tackling research . I'd like to delve into how researchers like yourself visualize and approach problems, particularly how you develop ideas and hypotheses. 

***Personal Reflection:***

As a researcher in the field of 3D vision, specifically point cloud classification/segmentation, I'm currently reflecting on my own research approach. Just recently I had a realization moment questioning the entire way I am trying to contribute as a junior researcher.  

***Case Study:***

To illustrate my current research style, let's consider one of my recent idea. well recently I've spent part of my time exploring a novel(ish) lightweight architecture for point cloud classification. explored the idea of bisecting (cutting in half) symmetrical objects along their longitudinal axis of the point cloud (3d object) . This approach aimed to achieve two goals: data size reduction and potential data augmentation. and what if we have two processing branches at some point along the pipeline!? 

as you can see my idea/hypothesis is a total abstract. I am walking into the ideas in a semi tangible and trivial human understanding logics. right? 

ignore whether or not the idea serves the research objective I mentioned at the first place. it is not my concern. 

***Central Questions:***

* I am particularly interested to know is it a right way to deal with the problem? is it the ultimate way of doing research and **this how ideas born in this field**?  
* Does my limited mathematical background hinder a more systematic, mathematically-driven approach to problem-solving, visualizing and thinking?
* If math isn't necessarily the initial focus, at what stage does it become crucial, and what advantages does its later integration offer?
* please share your experience and your way.

Over the last few months, I have been developing a tool that translates between American Sign Language (ASL) and English.

Basically, they only view Deafness as a disability and only seek to overcome the inability to hear, but not to translate to the language of ASL itself.

With guidance from my ASL teacher, I have been working on a project that facilitates this translation while respecting and preserving ASL as the primary language. For ASL reception, I augmented over 100,000 images of ASL alphabets using Google MediaPipe and trained a PointNet model to classify handshapes fingerspelled by Deaf individuals. For ASL expression, I augmented over 9,000 videos of ASL signs, embedded their corresponding words, and then used ThreeJS to sign words said by hearing individuals. I also used LLMs to improve accuracy and translate between English and ASL grammar.

        google_api_key=""your_google_api_key"",
        google_cx=""your_google_cx"",
        completion_client=Groq(api_key=""your_groq_api_key"")
    )
    
    # Search and get results
    query = ""I want to do a left join in python polars""
    results = ragoon.search(
        query=query,
        completion_model=""Llama3-70b-8192"",
        max_tokens=512,
        temperature=1,
    )

Overall it went better than I expected, I use \`mss\` to take screenshots of the monitor(s), and use ollama and llava and mxbai embed to generate descriptions and embeddings of the screenshots, and then chromadb for storage and search.

There is definitely huge room for improvement here:

* There are plenty of hallucinations in the generated descriptions of screenshots, this could be a combination of the size the MLLM used to generate the descriptions (I use a very small model because I have a rusty 1060), or because the screenshots are very high in resolutions (no resizing is done after a screenshot).
* The search is very basic, it just matches the embeddings of the query text with the embeddings of the screenshots, a potential improvement could be to use the model to enrich the user query with more information before embedding it for search.
* I am fairly certain that Microsoft does not rely solely on screenshots as I do, but also captures of individual app windows, and also extracts meta information like window title, maybe even the text content of the window (the same text used by text-to-speech programs for the visually impaired), these could definitely improve the results.

Do you have any further ideas on what could be changed?

    Fine-tuning Aligned Language Models Compromises Safety, Even When Users Do Not Intend To!
    
    ### Problem Definition:
    The paper investigates the risks associated with fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in terms of their safety alignments. Specifically, it examines how different types of tuning datasets — harmful, identity-shifting, and benign — can lead to the degradation of these safety alignments in both open-source (e.g., Llama) and closed-source (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo) models.
    
    ### Contribution:
    1. **New Findings on Fine-Tuning**: The paper demonstrates that safety alignment of LLMs can be severely compromised by simple fine-tuning techniques, even with benign datasets.
    2. **Three Levels of Risk Hierarchy**: The research identifies three levels of risk associated with different types of tuning datasets and their impacts on model alignment.
    3. **Mitigation Strategies**: The authors propose initial mitigation strategies, mainly focusing on closed models, to counter these vulnerabilities.
    4. **Empirical Evidence**: Comprehensive empirical evaluations, including additional qualitative examples from different LLMs, are provided to substantiate the claims.
    
    ### Importance of Contribution or Approaches:
    1. **Highlighting Vulnerabilities**: The study reveals significant vulnerabilities in current safety alignment techniques, emphasizing the need for more robust safety measures in the AI community.
    2. **Societal Impact**: Given the dependence on LLMs in various sensitive applications, the findings stress the urgency of developing stronger safety protocols and regulatory guidelines.
    3. **Broad Applicability**: The paper's findings extend beyond adversarial contexts, informing developers and stakeholders across multiple disciplines about potential safety risks in downstream applications.
    4. **Trade-Off Insights**: It provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between model customization and maintaining safety, crucial for future AI developments and policies.
    
    ### Weakness or Doubts:
    1. **Predictability of Findings**: Some reviewers noted that certain results, such as safety degradation due to distribution shifts, are not entirely surprising and have been observed in previous works.
    2. **Evaluation Clarity**: The methodology, especially in Sections 4.2 and 4.3, lacked clarity. Reviewers suggested that additional evaluations on normal tasks and a focus on different models would strengthen the findings.
    3. **Lack of Novelty**: The technical contribution of the paper was perceived as limited, given that the used fine-tuning techniques are relatively simple.
    4. **In-depth Exploration**: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the underlying principles behind the observed fragilities in safety alignment, including the mechanisms leading to these vulnerabilities.
    5. **Dataset Relevance**: Concerns were raised about the representativeness of the custom-created evaluation dataset and the decision not to widely publish it, potentially affecting reproducibility.
    
    Overall, the paper raises important concerns and provides empirical data on the fragility of current LLM safety alignment methodologies, urging the AI community to rethink and strengthen alignment strategies.

In the past, tabular data classification was dominated by tree-based algorithms like XGBoost and CatBoost, but now we are finally closing this gap using pretrained transformers.

https://preview.redd.it/c3unlgi1cq2d1.png?width=2690&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd414509a31a189df288668e928d52e5723df3fc

In-context learning transformers were introduced to tabular data classification by Hollman et al. (ICLR, 2023) in [TabPFN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.01848). This work is limited by the GPU memory, so it only considers datasets with fewer than a thousand observations. We improve their model by adding a fine-tuning stage, which circumvents the GPU memory limitation. Also, we introduce an additional synthetic data *forest* generator to further boost the performance. The result is [TabForestPFN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13396).

The focus of the TabForestPFN [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13396) is about *why* we can pretrain on tabular data. In language and vision, pretraining can learn grammar and textures, so pretraining makes sense. But in tabular data, the datasets in pretraining share no features or labels with the real-world datasets of interest, so what could it even learn? In the paper, we argue in-context learning transformers learn the ability to create complex decision boundaries. If you are interested in the reasoning, give it a read.

Code is available at [https://github.com/FelixdenBreejen/TabForestPFN](https://github.com/FelixdenBreejen/TabForestPFN)  
With the code, you can reproduce all our pretraining, experiments and analysis, and it also includes some basic examples for you to immediately use the classifier on your own datasets.

Below are the results of TabForestPFN on two tabular data classification benchmarks. I am the author, so if there are any questions, feel free to ask.

First step is to convert patch to patch embeddings to feed into n/w so we add a simple linear transformation (FCN) for dims reduction and matrix->vector. What is learnt here? Are there any weights? Or is it just shrinking the 2d patch input to a 1d vector.

Since these patches are processed(linear transformed) in parallel, they have no idea on other patch information. People say patch to patch interaction happen in attention layer BUT there are no learnable params in attention layer it's just transpose and multiple query key patch.

Does the backprop in attention layer loss cause weights to change in patch embedding layer??

Also, why do they call as linear transformation of patch embedding? Aren't they adding any activation function, it's supposed to be non linear transformation right?",15,33

**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13226)

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are commonly trained on datasets consisting of fixed-length token sequences. These datasets are created by randomly concatenating documents of various lengths and then chunking them into sequences of a predetermined target length. However, this method of concatenation can lead to cross-document attention within a sequence, which is neither a desirable learning signal nor computationally efficient. Additionally, training on long sequences becomes computationally prohibitive due to the quadratic cost of attention. In this study, we introduce dataset decomposition, a novel variable sequence length training technique, to tackle these challenges. We decompose a dataset into a union of buckets, each containing sequences of the same size extracted from a unique document. During training, we use variable sequence length and batch size, sampling simultaneously from all buckets with a curriculum. In contrast to the concat-and-chunk baseline, which incurs a fixed attention cost at every step of training, our proposed method incurs a penalty proportional to the actual document lengths at each step, resulting in significant savings in training time. We train an 8k context-length 1B model at the same cost as a 2k context-length model trained with the baseline approach. Experiments on a web-scale corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances performance on standard language evaluations and long-context benchmarks, reaching target accuracy 3x faster compared to the baseline. Our method not only enables efficient pretraining on long sequences but also scales effectively with dataset size. Lastly, we shed light on a critical yet less studied aspect of training large language models: the distribution and curriculum of sequence lengths, which results in a non-negligible difference in performance.

**Abstract:** Over the past years, YOLOs have emerged as the predominant paradigm in the field of real-time object detection owing to their effective balance between computational cost and detection performance. Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8× faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8× smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\\% less latency and 25\\% fewer parameters for the same performance.

I recently got interested in ML compilers, and wanted to ask some questions.

### 1. ML Compilers vs language compilers

I'm curious if ML compilers and language compilers have a lot in common. I only know a bit about the frontend part of a compiler, but it looks like ML compilers don't really have the usual lexical / syntax / semantic analysis phases that language compilers go through.

Would the backend part be much more relevant for ML compilers though? Would you recommend learning topics like IR optimization, register/memory allocation or SSA first before getting into ML compilers? It feels like ML compiler is a beast of its own, so I'm not sure if I should just dive into it, or having a background in traditional compiler backend would be still very helpful.

At least the [MLIR paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11054) seems to talk about SSA and IRs, so maybe having some compiler backend background is necessary? Just to clarify, I know the definition of SSA and IR, but here I'm talking about going in depths about these topics.

### 2. Focus areas within ML compilers

I'm also curious what are the areas that require the most amount of work within ML compilers? Is it the IR (or graph) optimization? Or something else? Do you think this domain is something that will last for decades, or mostly a few years effort and then users won't have to care about the internals anymore (just like how a normal user don't really care about how gcc or clang compiles C code too much nowadays)",1,7

My question is, since we are clipping the probability ratio of the current policy vs the previous policy, why is the clipping not symmetric? Ie, shouldn't eps be divided / multiplied, instead of subtracted / added? For example, if we wanted to prevent the current policy from deviating within 0.5 of its starting point, wouldn't we actually want to clip the probability ratio at (0.5, 2)?

* Binary embeddings during CLIP rank-tuning preserve between 87-93% of fp32 embeddings.
* Pseudo-quantization with sigmoid with 4x scaled temperature is (almost) universally better than tanh (see next point).
* Cosine similarity on 0/1 (sigmoid) is better than -1, 1 (tanh) - pretty sure this is because cosine has better degeneracy (D vs DxN) as it penalises embeddings that are not on the same hyper-sphere (it also biases for fewer non-zero elements).
* Use L1 to approximate hamming distance during training which is marginally better than cosine (for 0/1).
* Evaluated using [GS-10M](https://github.com/marqo-ai/GCL) for multimodal retrieval using exact KNN.

I’m working on building a commercial app that involves an object detection model. I’m considering using YOLOv7 with my own training data, but I’m concerned about the licensing. YOLOv7 is licensed under GNU GPL 3.0, which would require me to make the source code of my whole app open source if YOLOv7 is integrated into it.

I’m curious about how others handle this situation. Specifically:

1. Do developers often resort to using different, older models that have more permissive licenses for commercial applications?
2. Are there any alternative approaches, such as training a model from scratch using the YOLOv7 repo (so that it is not a derivative of the repo), and build my own inference pipeline that does not use the YOLOv7 codebase for inference? For example using ONNX.

I would really appreciate any insights or experiences.

I'm working on variational inference methods, mainly in the context of BNNs. Using the reverse (exclusive) KL as the variational objective is the common approach, though lately I stumbled upon some interesting works that use the forward (inclusive) KL as an objective instead, e.g \[1\]\[2\]\[3\]. Also in the context of VI for GPs both divergence measures have been used, see e.g \[4\].

While I'm familiar with the well-known difference between the objectives that the reverse KL is 'mode-seeking' and the forward KL is 'mode covering', I see some of these works making claims about downstream differences of these VI objectives such as (paraphrasing here) *""the reverse KL underestimates predictive variance"" \[4\]* and *""the forward KL is useful for applications benefiting from conservative uncertainty quantification"" \[3\]*.

I'm interested in understanding these downstream differences in the context of VI, but haven't found any works that explain these claims theoretically instead of empirically. Anyone who can point me in the right direction or have a go at explaining this?

I am working on a large database of a company \[Consider a Fortune 2500\]. There are multiple functions (100+) across the company which do not really overlap too much - marketing & manufacturing for instance. 

Now for various teams within the company I want to give each department a RAG enabled chat system to play with. Someone from marketing department does some search on a topic like - ""What was CAC for Product A in the year 2023?"". Now it goes and looks for that information across vectors in an index, but in parallel it also looks for the information in 99 other indices (considering 100 departments = 100 indices). If top\_k=10, then likely, it's going to come up with 1000 results, which would be passed as context to LLM which may become very large resulting in increased latency and  pricing. 

I am thinking of creating a master index, that has top\_k = 10 (example) which then selects 10 most relevant indices based on what a user is looking for and then searches within those 10 indices, giving 100 results instead of 1000. 

I know these numbers would need to be optimized a lot, but has anyone heard about creating a vector database (on chroma or pinecone) where there's a master index and sub indices. Is it recommended for a RAG model? Is there any reading material on it?

ReproModel is a no-code toolbox that enables scientists and researchers to test and reproduce ML models efficiently. A large subset of research time is wasted trying to test models from existing papers. To replicate or test results, you’d have to look into the provided code, and mimic all the config files and experiment conditions, i.e data loaders, preprocessing, optimizers etc. 

The toolbox takes all of that away through fetching config files from existing papers (will be available soon), loading models directly, and testing them on your data through simple checkboxes and dropdown menus. Customization is, of course, possible and encouraged.

You can find the repo here. Of course, more work has to be done, but I am approaching this step-by-step to ensure future compatibility and reusability of code.

I am working on a problem which is a multi-variate timeseries regression problem, in particular, developing a surrogate for a (very slow) physics based simulation.

Inputs: 

34 features x 35040 timesteps (15 min interval data for one year) + 90 categorical features (ie static for entire year) with 4-56 options for each category. 

Outputs:

8 features x 35040 timesteps

My basic approach is this:

1. (b, 90 features) > embedding layer > MLP network (a few layers, intermittent skip connections etc) > (b, 96 timesteps, m features) ie create a unique latent representation of the categorical features for each interval of a day > repeat x 365 (to get to 35040 timesteps)
2. Concatenate latent timeseries representation of categorical features with the 34 timeseries feature. 
3. d_model for mamba is m + 34 (currently working with m=94 so d_model is 128)
4. Chunk the timeseries according to a desired context size and send through mamba and a final linear layer to mix down to the final number of timeseries in the output. Using a single chunk means the entire year is processed in a single pass, whereas using 73 chunks corresponds to 5 days. 

Now, the interesting question is what to set as the context/chunking size for Mamba. From a physics perspective, the maximum causal horizon (correct term?) is probably about a day - ie the state of the inputs and system over the last 24 hours are relevant to compute the next timestep in a white box solver, but beyond that the past doesn’t affect the system. However, because the timeseries inputs/timesteps are not IID/uniformly random in the dataset (they theoretically could be mathematically but realistic data is used), it’s of course possible (and at least somewhat likely) that there is mutual information shared between timesteps beyond the causal horizon. 

I’m getting pretty decent results with a context size of 480 timesteps (5 days) and backpropping after each chunk (and during inference, processing a whole year in chunks of the same size) but I don’t have any good intuition about tradeoffs of using a larger or smaller context size here besides how it affects the VRAM requirements during training. 

I’d love to start a discussion here about it!

Or anything else in this architecture. If you have any good papers that implement a similar approach to combining categorical and timeseries data I would love to see it!",1,4

Has anyone attempted to augment their training datasets with random noise (or random combinations of training examples)? In this strategy, my intuition is that you'd be injecting essentially negative counter examples - and you'd want the label vectors to have a high amount of entropy.

There has been a lot of hype about the promise of autonomous agent-based LLM workflows. By now, all major LLMs are capable of interacting with external tools and functions, letting the LLM perform sequences of tasks automatically.

But reality is proving more challenging than anticipated.

The [WebArena leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M801lEpBbKSNwP-vDBkC_pF7LdyGU1f_ufZb_NWNBZQ/edit#gid=0), which benchmarks LLMs agents against real-world tasks, shows that even the best-performing models have a success rate of only 35.8%.

# Challenges in Practice

After seeing many attempts to AI agents, I believe it's too early, too expensive, too slow, too unreliable.  
It feels like many AI agent startups are waiting for a model breakthrough that will start the race to productize agents.

* Reliability: As we all know, LLMs are prone to hallucinations and inconsistencies. Chaining multiple AI steps compounds these issues, especially for tasks requiring exact outputs.
* Performance and costs: GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5, and Claude Opus are working quite well with tool usage/function calling, but they are still slow and expensive, particularly if you need to do loops and automatic retries.
* Legal concerns: Companies may be held liable for the mistakes of their agents. A [recent example](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/16/air-canada-chatbot-lawsuit) is Air Canada being ordered to pay a customer who was misled by the airline's chatbot.
* User trust: The ""black box"" nature of AI agents and stories like the above makes it hard for users to understand and trust their outputs. Gaining user trust for sensitive tasks involving payments or personal information will be hard (paying bills, shopping, etc.).

# Real-World Attempts

Several startups are tackling the AI agent space, but most are still experimental or invite-only:

* [adept.ai](https://www.adept.ai/) - $350M funding, but access is still very limited
* [MultiOn](https://www.multion.ai) - funding unknown, their API-first approach seems promising
* [HypeWrite](https://www.hyperwriteai.com/personal-assistant) - $2.8M funding, started with an AI writing assistant and expanded into the agent space
* [minion.ai](https://minion.ai) - created some initial buzz but has gone quiet now, waitlist only

Only MultiOn seems to be pursuing the ""give it instructions and watch it go"" approach, which is more in line with the promise of AI agents.  
All others are going down the record-and-replay RPA route, which may be necessary for reliability at this stage.

Large players are also bringing AI capabilities to desktops and browsers, and it looks like we'll get native AI integrations on a system level:

* OpenAI announced their Mac desktop app that can interact  with the OS screen.
* At Google I/O, Google demonstrated Gemini [automatically processing a shopping return](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRY_T-hBp74).
* Microsoft [announced Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio), which will let developers build AI agent bots.

Screenshot Screenshot

These tech demos are impressive, but we'll see how well these agent capabilities will work when released publicly and tested against real-world scenarios instead of hand-picked demo cases.

# The Path Forward

AI agents overhyped and it's too early.  
However, the underlying models continue to advance quickly, and we can expect to see more successful real-world applications.  
Instead of trying to have one large general purpose agent that is hard to control and test, we can use many smaller agents that basically just pick the right strategy for a specific sub-task in our workflows. These ""agents"" can be thought of as medium-sized LLM prompts with a) context and b) a set of functions available to call.

The most promising path forward likely looks like this:

1. Narrowly scoped, well testable automations that use AI as an augmentation tool rather than pursuing full autonomy
2. Human-in-the-loop approaches that keep humans involved for oversight and handling edge cases
3. Setting realistic expectations about current capabilities and limitations

By combining tightly constrained agents, good evaluation data, human-in-the-loop oversight, and traditional engineering methods, we can achieve reliably good results for automating medium-complex tasks.

Will AI agents automate tedious repetitive work, such as web scraping, form filling, and data entry? Yes, absolutely.

Will AI agents autonomously book your vacation without your intervention? Unlikely, at least in the near future.",65,295

To begin this experiment, we collected 10 hours of OpenAI TTS data to perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both the LLM (medium) and VITS models, which took approximately 30 minutes. After that, we used 15 seconds of audio as a prompt during inference.

Demos Available: [here](https://firefly-ai.notion.site/OpenAI-Examples-34975ae263a9496c84e89fb7b1ea25a4?pvs=4).

As you can see, the model's emotion, rhythm, accent, and timbre match the OpenAI speakers, though there is some degradation in audio quality, which we are working on. To avoid any legal issues, we are unable to release the fine-tuned model, but I believe everyone can tune [fish-speech](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech) to this level within hours and for around $20.

Our experiment shows that with only 25 seconds of prompts (few-shot learning), without any fine-tuning, the model can mimic most behaviors except details like timbre and how it reads numbers. To the best of our knowledge, you can clone how someone speaks in English, Chinese, and Japanese with 30 minutes of data using this framework.

&#x200B;

While LLMs such as GPT-4 are commonly used in the training process of smaller BERT-like models (pseudo-labelling or data augmentation), we wondered if they could also be used as active learning agents. In contrast to conventional active learning, we see the opportunity that LLMs are really good at capturing the diversity and difficulty of examples and do not face a cold start problem. Conventional active learning often requires many seed instances, which makes it somewhat unattractive for many tasks where BERT models already achieve good performance in few-shot scenarios.

&#x200B;

We experiment with different LLMs as active learning components and indeed show that they can significantly improve performance in few-shot scenarios:

**TLDR:** AgentClinic turns static medical QA problems into agents in a clinical environment (doctor, patient, medical devices) in order to present a more clinically relevant challenge for medical language models.

**Abstract:** Diagnosing and managing a patient is a complex, sequential decision making process that requires physicians to obtain information---such as which tests to perform---and to act upon it. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) promise to profoundly impact clinical care. However, current evaluation schemes overrely on static medical question-answering benchmarks, falling short on interactive decision-making that is required in real-life clinical work. Here, we present AgentClinic: a multimodal benchmark to evaluate LLMs in their ability to operate as agents in simulated clinical environments. In our benchmark, the doctor agent must uncover the patient's diagnosis through dialogue and active data collection. We present two open benchmarks: a multimodal image and dialogue environment, AgentClinic-NEJM, and a dialogue-only environment, AgentClinic-MedQA. Agents in AgentClinic-MedQA are grounded in cases from the US Medical Licensing Exam\~(USMLE) and AgentClinic-NEJM are grounded in multimodal New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) case challenges. We embed cognitive and implicit biases both in patient and doctor agents to emulate realistic interactions between biased agents. We find that introducing bias leads to large reductions in diagnostic accuracy of the doctor agents, as well as reduced compliance, confidence, and follow-up consultation willingness in patient agents. Evaluating a suite of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that several models that excel in benchmarks like MedQA are performing poorly in AgentClinic-MedQA. We find that the LLM used in the patient agent is an important factor for performance in the AgentClinic benchmark. We show that both having limited interactions as well as too many interaction reduces diagnostic accuracy in doctor agents.",0,5

Quick disclaimer: I am aware that there is an internaltional standard for labeling the diferent recognized speech sounds (phonemes), but I wanted ASCII or extended ASCII for programming simplification, so I use a different nomeclature. Besides, it's easier for me to recognize and read. -Please forgive me

&#x200B;

So I have often wondered about the real rules that govern speech that people use. For instance using something similar to a ""glottal stop"" to end words like ""don't"" and ""that"". The ""t"" is not pronounced. Or how ""r"" is almost always used as a vowel (in american english). My favorite examples are ""fur"", ""fir"", and ""-fer"". All three are pronounced identically and the typical ""i,u,e"" vowels are not pronounced at all. Its just pronounced ""fr"".

&#x200B;

One day I was looking at a spectrograph of my voice, and I noticed some patterns. Vowels like ""ah"" in ""stop"" and ""Bob"" look very different from other vowels like ""ee"" in ""green"" and ""bee"". When we speak, there is the most prominant lowest frequency called the ""fundamental"", and there are many other frequencies that are multiples of that frequency called ""harmonics"". The sound ""ah"" has high volume on many of the harmonics, but the sound ""ee"" has a big gap where the harmonics are much much smaller. Every different vowel had its own combination of different harmonic values.

&#x200B;

So I tried to create a set of rules by hand to classify different frequency patterns as different vowels. I could easily tell them apart by looking at them, but would the rules hold up to the test? So I made a computer program to guess different vowels, but it was not good. There are so many knobs to turn to create the different rules. And if there is variability, then I would also have to go through and determine all of the different ranges which would make the rules much more complex. 

&#x200B;

I started to do it by hand and tweak values, see how it worked, and then tweak the values again, etc, etc.

&#x200B;

Thats when it hit me! I'm doing what a neural network trainer does. I could use one to do this for me!

&#x200B;

So I researched the nitty gritty of getting one setup, recorded a lot of data (\~45 minutes worth) and trained the model. It took a few days to figure out some problems, but I eventually got it working.

&#x200B;

I used python and the tensoflow+keras library suite to create and train the neural network, Pyaudio for recording training data and realtime audio, numpy for data analysis. The neural network had 264 input nodes, 100 intermediate nodes, and 13 output nodes (one node for ""no vowel"", and 12 for the different vowels). The frequency calculation finishes within 1milisecond, and the neural network finishes within 2 milisecond as well on my hardware (intel i3-1115G4 at 4GHz). It spends more of its time on listening for audio than it does computing the answer. I found best results by running the loop 20 times per second (50ms) but I have also gotten it to run at 50 times per second (20ms), but it struggles on one or two vowels.

&#x200B;

Here is a list of the different vowels that it recognizes

I don't even understand how it can change the actual parameters of the LM, especially if we're using third party API calls for the LMs. 

By LM weights, I assume it means the weights of the last layers of the transformer model. When they describe optimizers, they say ""DSPy introduces new optimizers, which are LM-driven algorithms that can tune the prompts and/or the weights of your LM calls, given a metric you want to maximize.""

My RNN setting

    embedding_dim = 384
    hidden_dim = 512
    num_layers = 3
    output_dim = 180
    num_epochs = 100
    learning_rate = 0.001
    rnn_model = RNN(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, output_dim)

but the problem is whatever I input the output is the same everytime! but when I try changing num\_layers to 1 and keep other setting the same like this

    embedding_dim = 384
    hidden_dim = 512
    num_layers = 1
    output_dim = 180
    num_epochs = 100
    learning_rate = 0.001
    rnn_model = RNN(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers, output_dim)

the loss now look like this [loss image with num\_layers=1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-Q6qOr8yPWn0gYL74tnbPm7zBIPrFOz/view?usp=sharing) and now the problem is gone !!

Also I try to check the cause of the ""output is the same everytime"" problem I check dataloader and other code but no problem was found only num\_layers=3 that cause the problem num\_layers=1 fixed it

This is my training loop

    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(rnn_model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
    
    trainingEpoch_loss = []
    validationEpoch_loss = []

            training_loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()

          validationStep_loss.append(val_loss.item())

This is my Inference

    text = ""a man running""
    processed_text = torch.tensor(sentence_model.encode(text), dtype=torch.float)
    output_poses = rnn_model(processed_text.unsqueeze(0))
    print(output_poses.shape) #shape=(1, 180) 1 person is 36 (original data for 1 person is 54 but I change to 36 because I want only x and y and not z so cut out the z axis) and there's 5 person so 5*36 = 180

My question is

1. Is there any model architecture recommend for this task other than RNN?
2. Why whatever I input the output is the same everytime when num\_layers=3 I'm very confused because the loss wouldn't go down if the model was giving the same output right? that's mean it give the same output in the Inference phase

2. Answer why whatever I input the output is the same everytime when num\_layers=3",1,1

Creating a distributed system of 50k CPUs for the rollout, 1k GPUs for training while taking between 8k and 80k actions from 16k observations per 0.25s—how crazy is that?? They also were doing “surgeries” on the RL model to recover weights as their reward function, observation space, and even architecture has changed over the couple months of training. Last but not least, they beat the OG team (world champions at the time) and deployed the agent to play live with other players online. 

Fast forward a couple of years, they are predicting the next token in a sequence. Don’t get me wrong, the capabilities of gpt4 and its omni version are truly amazing feat of engineering and research (probably much more useful), but they don’t seem to be as interesting (from the research perspective) as some of their previous work.

I notice that many people (including myself and those that I review) often recycle their submissions for ML conferences.

E.g., if their papers got rejected by ICML, they submit to NeurIPS, and later to ICLR (or UAI/AISTATS which are also top in my field). If they did not get into ICML/NeurIPS/ICLR after 2\~3 times, they would submit them to AAAI/IJCAI/TMLR/ICDM, journals like T-NNLS/T-KDD/NN/Neurocomputing, or domain-specific venues like LoG/CoLLAs/AABI. After all these, if the paper still did not get accepted, they then simply put them or arXiv. I believe this might also be the case for CV/NLP.

As a reviewer, I often encounter conference submissions where the authors resubmit without really taking into account the previous reviews provided. Sometimes they do incorporate the reviews when resubmitting--but sometimes the work may just be not at the level of Tier 1 conferences but they just keep resubmitting and hoping that they can accepted by chance.

I think that this is consuming a lot of reviewers' time from the community to keep reviewing the same submissions (especially given that NeurIPS hits 20k submission id; I expect to see many resubmissions). This is perhaps also one of the reason TMLR was born (to emphasize correctness instead of novelty).

I do understand arguments like ""the quality of research is more important than the publication venues"" or ""OpenAI often simply just put their papers like GPT-X on arXiv these days"". However, students or junior researchers also need publications in their career, including myself.

Hi everyone 

I want to attend ICML for the first time. I’m super excited but have a few questions.

Background: I’m currently doing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence.

My questions are:

1. Conference + Tutorial + Workshop tickets are kind of expensive and it’s a bit inconvenient for me to attend for a whole week. I’m unsure if I should only attend workshops, or the full conference plus workshops. Could someone explain what exactly the difference between workshop sessions and conference sessions is? And does one make more sense to attend as a student than another?

2. On the ICML homepage in the schedule I cannot see the topics of the speeches at the conference. It only says “Oral 1”, “Oral 2”, etc. It says I need to be registered (~500EUR) to even see the topics of the speeches. Is this normal? I’d like to know which speeches there are before purchasing a ticket.

Thanks so much in advance for answering my noob questions! Any help/info is very much appreciated!",4,0

**Abstract**:

>We ask whether multilingual language models trained on unbalanced, English-dominated corpora use English as an internal pivot language -- a question of key importance for understanding how language models function and the origins of linguistic bias. Focusing on the Llama-2 family of transformer models, our study uses carefully constructed non-English prompts with a unique correct single-token continuation. From layer to layer, transformers gradually map an input embedding of the final prompt token to an output embedding from which next-token probabilities are computed. Tracking intermediate embeddings through their high-dimensional space reveals three distinct phases, whereby intermediate embeddings (1) start far away from output token embeddings; (2) already allow for decoding a semantically correct next token in the middle layers, but give higher probability to its version in English than in the input language; (3) finally move into an input-language-specific region of the embedding space. We cast these results into a conceptual model where the three phases operate in ""input space"", ""concept space"", and ""output space"", respectively. Crucially, our evidence suggests that the abstract ""concept space"" lies closer to English than to other languages, which may have important consequences regarding the biases held by multilingual language models.",0,16

However, it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to generalise to new domains, or if other inductive biases are sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent capable of satisfying a regret bound under a large set of distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal model of the data generating process, which converges to the true causal model for optimal agents.

We are organizing the **Differentiable almost everything** workshop at ICML this year.

Many discrete operations e.g. sorting, topk, shortest paths, clustering (and many more) have null-gradients almost everywhere, and are hence not suitable for modern gradient based learning frameworks (such as deep learning). This workshop will cover research topics that aim to remedy such problems!

[https://differentiable.xyz/](https://differentiable.xyz/)

We encourage anyone who is working on relevant topics to submit their work. Even if you are not submitting, please do come by the workshop at ICML to see some of the exciting talks that will take place!

I have attached a full summary of the workshop below! All the best with your current work, L :)

*Gradients and derivatives are integral to machine learning, as they enable gradient-based optimization. In many real applications, however, models rest on algorithmic components that implement discrete decisions, or rely on discrete intermediate representations and structures. These discrete steps are intrinsically non-differentiable and accordingly break the flow of gradients. To use gradient-based approaches to learn the parameters of such models requires turning these non-differentiable components differentiable. This can be done with careful considerations, notably, using smoothing or relaxations to propose differentiable proxies for these components. With the advent of modular deep learning frameworks, these ideas have become more popular than ever in many fields of machine learning, generating in a short time-span a multitude of “differentiable everything”, impacting topics as varied as rendering, sorting and ranking, convex optimizers, shortest-paths, dynamic programming, physics simulations, NN architecture search, top-k, graph algorithms, weakly- and self-supervised learning, and many more.*

*This workshop will provide a forum for anything differentiable, bringing together academic and industry researchers to highlight challenges and developments, provide unifying ideas, discuss practical implementation choices and explore future directions.*",14,85

Historically government agencies have had secret technology that was far more advanced than the public was aware of.  Obvious examples are the airforce like the sr-71, and the decommissioned nro equipment that was loaned to hubble because it was too outdated for them to care.  In the ml space,  I had a professor claim that the cia had effectively discovered viterbi years before the public version and only admitted it years later (but I have not been able to verify this story).

Is it possible that there is secret government research into ai that is more advanced than the like of openai? The applications and demands seem obvious.  I don't want confidential information,  I'm just curious if it's even considered possible.  In my previous examples the government could fund projects at a scale that no one else would.  But public companies are already spending billions, hiring the best talent, and in many cases have massive private datasets. I'm not sure if the cia actually has any edge over the likes of alphabet.

It consists of several parts:

**Data indexing pipeline (incremental):**

1. We extract tables as images during the parsing process.
2. GPT-4o explains the content of the table in detail.
3. The table content is then saved with the document chunk into the index, making it easily searchable.

**Question Answering:**

Then, questions are sent to the LLM with the relevant context (including parsed tables) for the question answering.

**Results:**

Our method has outperformed traditional RAG toolkits on questions based on tables. To demonstrate this, we used a few sample questions derived from the Alphabet's 10K report, which is packed with many tables.

I am sharing a recent experience as a PhD student and seeking advice on interpreting a methodological oversight in our study.

Upon reflection on a recent paper we submitted (I already submitted the camera-ready version), I realized we made a methodological error. Specifically, we used a validation set derived from the test set, potentially introducing bias into our results because we have heterogeneous datasets (training and test datasets are from different origins). We monitored the accuracy of the validation set and used it for early stopping. But the correct method is to make the validation set from the training set, right? I got confused because I read that in some cases, some people use validation set and test set for the same purpose.

I was surprised that neither my coauthors nor the three reviewers spotted this error during the peer-review process. Does the oversight of neither my coauthors nor the reviewers identifying the error imply that its severity can be downplayed?

Additionally, we conducted measurements on five tests to average our results - but I'm uncertain about whether this helps mitigate the impact of the error. Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I am ready to mention this error during my presentation for transparency, but I feel a bit dumb.

EDIT: Using that validation set for early stopping or not hasn't changed the capability of our model to be robust on unseen data. So... is the error negligeable?",2,3

I understand how things like PCA, t-SNE, UMAP, etc etc work (and these are 90% of what comes up when looking for dimensionality dimensionality reduction), but when I read about subspace clustering, manifold learning, or things in this area, they rarely mention these more basic dim reduc techniques and instead opt for more advanced methods and I'm not sure why, especially given how prolific PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP seem to be.

It is unclear to me whether/how things like PCA are different from say manifold learning, particularly in their usefulness for subspace clustering. I think the goals of both are to find some latent structure, with the intuition that working in the latent space will reduce noise, useless / low info features, reduce the curse of dimensionality, and also potentially more clearly show how the features and labels are connected in the latent space. In terms of the actual algorithms, I am understand the intuition but not whether they are ""real"". For instance, in the case of manifold learning (which, FWIW, I don't really see any papers about anymore and don't know why this is), a common example is the ""face manifold"" for images, that is a smooth surface of lower dims than the original input dimensions, and smoothly transitions from every face to another. This may be a little more trivial for images, but for general time series data, does this same intuition extend? 

For instance, if I have a dataset of time series caterpillar movement, can I arbitrarily say that there exists a manifold of catepillar size (bigger catepillars move slower) or a manifold of caterpillar ability (say, some kind of ability/skill manifold, if the caterpillars are completing a task/maze)? Very contrived example, but basically the question is if it is necessarily the case that I should be able to find a latent space based on what my priors tell me should exist / may hold latent structure (given enough data)?

I know Yann LeCun is a big proponent of working in latent spaces (more so with joint embeddings, which I am not sure whether that is applicable to me and my time series data), so I am trying to take my work more in that direction, but it seems like there's a big divide between basic PCA and basic nonlinear techniques (eg the ones you would see built into scipy or sklearn or whatever) and techniques that are used in some other papers. Do PCA (or basic nonlinear methods) and the like achieve the same thing but just not as well?",13,130

I am currently researching the topic of using ML algorithms for Rate Adaptation (RAA) in wireless networks, specifically 802.11ax. My research objective is to demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of ML algorithms (in this case DQN) and how they are able to surpass conventional algorithms like Minstrel or Ideal in throughput.

To do this research, I am using Network Simulator 3 (NS3) as the main training and testing environment for the DQN algorithm. Then, to solve the problem of communicating between Python and NS3 (written in C++), I am using the [ns3-ai](https://github.com/hust-diangroup/ns3-ai/tree/main) module, which utilizes a shared memory pool approach to this situation.

The main problem I am encountering is the lack of implementation code anywhere on the internet on this specific topic. I have gone through a few research papers like ""[ns3-ai: Rate Control for Wireless LAN by Deep Q-Network](https://www.ieice.org/publications/proceedings/bin/pdf_link.php?fname=06_SS1-6_(16).pdf&iconf=SISA&year=2022&vol=69&number=SS1-6&lang=E)"", ""[NS3-AI: Enable Applying Artificial Intelligence to Network Simulation in ns-3](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341989036_ns3-ai_Fostering_Artificial_Intelligence_Algorithms_for_Networking_Research)"", and ""[Rate Adaptation with Q-Learning in CSMA/CA Wireless Networks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348620562_Rate_Adaptation_with_Q-Learning_in_CSMACA_Wireless_Networks)"". While they did give me valuable insights, they never go in depth about how exactly the code was written.

So, my questions is, how would I go upon using DQN in NS3 and ns3-ai? How would I observe the states and perform actions in NS3? Given that it is not the typical gymnasium environment where the environment kind of ""accepts"" actions.

Here is what I have tried.

* I have tried to understand/reverse-engineer the sample code provided
* I have read through their tutorial, but it only describes a simple scenario of sending data back and forth between Python and C++, disregarding the NS3 simulation environment.
* The creator says that there is skeleton code but I can't find it.

This is my first time submitting to NeurIPS.

Does anyone know when the reviews are visible to the authors? August, or is it possible that earlier? If we have really bad reviews... The best thing is to exit the submission path, right? In that case, which alternatives do you recommend on those dates?

My topic is NN reliability, but I am always underconfident about my research and I always think that it is not enough, more if I think in a conference as Neurips. Do you think that everybody submits good papers or is there a large quantity of rubbish papers? I read a lot of bad opinions here about the reviewing process... So, I am a little afraid.

This year, there are 20000ish submissions. So, I don't know what to do, if continue the submission or submit to another conference. As the gap that I am filling is clear, I am sure that others are covering that gap and submitting it to NeurIPS. Is there any other conference that outputs the results first than NeurIPS?

Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical when deploying machine learning models in the real world. Outlier exposure methods, which incorporate auxiliary outlier data in the training process, can drastically improve OOD detection performance compared to approaches without advanced training strategies. We introduce Hopfield Boosting, a boosting approach, which leverages modern Hopfield energy (MHE) to sharpen the decision boundary between the in-distribution and OOD data. Hopfield Boosting encourages the model to concentrate on hard-to-distinguish auxiliary outlier examples that lie close to the decision boundary between in-distribution and auxiliary outlier data. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection with outlier exposure, improving the FPR95 metric from 2.28 to 0.92 on CIFAR-10 and from 11.76 to 7.94 on CIFAR-100.",3,11

I'm excited to share our latest work on **MileBench**, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in long-context tasks involving multiple images and lengthy texts.

**Title:** MileBench: Benchmarking MLLMs in Long Context

**Homepage:** [https://milebench.github.io/](https://milebench.github.io/)

**Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18532](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18532)

**Code:** [https://github.com/MileBench/MileBench](https://github.com/MileBench/MileBench)

**Data:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/MileBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/MileBench)

# Why MileBench?

Existing benchmarks often overlook the complexity of tasks that involve multimodal long contexts. MileBench is the first to focus on these challenging scenarios, offering a more realistic assessment of MLLMs.

# Evaluation Types:

* Diagnostic Evaluation: Tests recall in long contexts with needle-in-a-haystack and image retrieval tasks.
* Realistic Evaluation: Simulates real-world scenarios with time-sequence and semantically related image tasks.

We collected **6,440** multimodal long-context samples from **21** existing or self-constructed datasets, with an average of **15.2** images and **422.3** words per sample. The table and figure show the detailed statistics of our datasets.

# Key Findings:

* Closed-source **GPT-4o** excelled in both diagnostic and realistic evaluations, but still short of perfect 100%.
* Most open-source MLLMs struggled with long-context tasks. Only Mantis and Qwen-VL-7B managed notable scores.

These results underscore that there are **""miles to go""** towards fully-realized long-context MLLMs.

# In-depth Analyses:

**Analysis 1: How do MLLMs perform with different context lengths?**

* Most models' performance drops as the number of images increases.
* Some models, like GPT-4o, perform better with a medium number of images.

**Analysis 2: Is there a ""Lost in the Middle"" Phenomenon in Long Contexts?**

* Strong long-text processing capabilities are crucial
* Qwen-VL-Chat showed some ""Lost in the Middle"" effects.

**Analysis 3: Combining Images Helps?**

To address input limitations, we combined multiple images into a single large image.

* Closed-source models performance dropped when combining images, except for Gemini 1.0
* High-resolution capabilities are crucial
* Some open-source models showed improved performance with combined images

# Want to Dive Deeper?

Our paper includes detailed experimental analyses, covering data contamination issues and task diversity. Check it out here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18532](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18532)

# Looking Ahead:

* Expanding MileBench to larger contexts and other modalities.
* Developing MLLMs that can efficiently handle complex, multimodal long-context tasks.

Abstract:

> Biological sensing and processing is asynchronous and sparse, leading to low-latency and energy-efficient perception and action. In robotics, neuromorphic hardware for event-based vision and spiking neural networks promises to exhibit similar characteristics. However, robotic implementations have been limited to basic tasks with low-dimensional sensory inputs and motor actions because of the restricted network size in current embedded neuromorphic processors and the difficulties of training spiking neural networks. Here, we present a fully neuromorphic vision-to-control pipeline for controlling a flying drone. Specifically, we trained a spiking neural network that accepts raw event-based camera data and outputs low-level control actions for performing autonomous vision-based flight. The vision part of the network, consisting of five layers and 28,800 neurons, maps incoming raw events to ego-motion estimates and was trained with self-supervised learning on real event data. The control part consists of a single decoding layer and was learned with an evolutionary algorithm in a drone simulator. Robotic experiments show a successful sim-to-real transfer of the fully learned neuromorphic pipeline. The drone could accurately control its ego-motion, allowing for hovering, landing, and maneuvering sideways—even while yawing at the same time. The neuromorphic pipeline runs on board on Intel’s Loihi neuromorphic processor with an execution frequency of 200 hertz, consuming 0.94 watt of idle power and a mere additional 7 to 12 milliwatts when running the network. These results illustrate the potential of neuromorphic sensing and processing for enabling insect-sized intelligent robots.

A straightfoward solution that came to me is to fine-tune an LLM with high-quality reviews on both good and bad papers,  giving it expertise to filter out low-quality papers, and implement a pre-review (some confs seem to arleady have that) to lower the demand for expert reviewers.

**Abstract**:

>Equation discovery is aimed at directly extracting physical laws from data and has emerged as a pivotal research domain. Previous methods based on symbolic mathematics have achieved substantial advancements, but often require the design of implementation of complex algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that utilizes natural language-based prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in automatically mining governing equations from data. Specifically, we first utilize the generation capability of LLMs to generate diverse equations in string form, and then evaluate the generated equations based on observations. In the optimization phase, we propose two alternately iterated strategies to optimize generated equations collaboratively. The first strategy is to take LLMs as a black-box optimizer and achieve equation self-improvement based on historical samples and their performance. The second strategy is to instruct LLMs to perform evolutionary operators for global search. Experiments are extensively conducted on both partial differential equations and ordinary differential equations. Results demonstrate that our framework can discover effective equations to reveal the underlying physical laws under various nonlinear dynamic systems. Further comparisons are made with state-of-the-art models, demonstrating good stability and usability. Our framework substantially lowers the barriers to learning and applying equation discovery techniques, demonstrating the application potential of LLMs in the field of knowledge discovery.",2,18

It is the result of five years of research and development, and I hope you find it useful for understanding the performance of deep neural networks. At 52 pages, the paper may appear daunting, but I think you will find it readable. The figures tell the story of the paper; simply scanning the figures and captions is a good approach, then drill down into the sections you find interesting.

Although many have noticed the disconnect between model efficiency (accuracy versus FLOPs) and actual efficiency (accuracy versus latency), previous attempts to improve actual efficiency have been unsatisfying. The convnets we use today were designed to circumvent the limitations of existing inference engines. They are not the models that would perform best with optimized software.

In fact, previous works do not compare model efficiency and actual efficiency directly. The prevailing view is that these two measurements are irreconcilable, and that counting the number of model FLOPs has limited usefulness.

I set out to create a solid foundation for model efficiency research by addressing these shortcomings. The first contribution is the ""Efficiency Gap"" plot, which shows model and actual efficiency in the same graph. We divide the model FLOPs by the processor's peak arithmetic throughput, yielding the ""ideal latency"" of the model. Ideal latency is the time that model inference would take if the software ran with 100% computational efficiency (i.e. 100% arithmetic utilization).

We plot ideal and actual latency as two curves on the same accuracy versus latency graph. We use log-scale on the latency axis, and the horizontal gap between the two curves equals the logarithm of the computational efficiency (i.e., the ratio between ideal and actual latency).

Efficiency gap plots of well known baseline models give us a precise analytical view of model performance. For example, the efficiency gap plots for EfficientNet show that its ideal latency is much lower than its actual latency, a result of impressive model efficiency and poor computational efficiency.

The plots also show us where modern convnets fall short. ConvNeXt has worse model efficiency than EfficientNet, yet still has lower actual latency because of better computational efficiency. This suggests that we could do better by finding a model that has low ideal latency and that affords high computational efficiency.

The next chapter of the paper creates a new performance model for neural networks to better understand the sources of computational efficiency. We correct the roofline model, which was never meant to be applied to a sequence of parallel kernels. Previous works overestimate the operational intensity of neural networks  by computing a single op: byte ratio for the entire application, despite the fact that this measurement only has meaning for operations that run in parallel. Our ""Waterline Model"" computes the minimum attainable latency for each kernel separately, ensuring an accurate performance estimate for a sequence of parallel kernels.

Waterline analysis shows that the performance of modern convnets suffer because the traditional conv2d layer has been replaced with a sequence of degenerate conv2d layers, each having less operational intensity than the original conv2d. Thus layer-by-layer execution of modern convnets is memory bound for many of the individual layers.

The intuition behind models like ConvNeXt that increased performance by making the models wider helps somewhat, but does not solve the computational efficiency problem. Also, these adaptations caused the model to use more operations to achieve the same accuracy.

In the next chapter, we address the computational efficiency head-on by writing GPU kernels that fuse all the degenerate layers of a convnet block into a single kernel. We also replace depth-wise convolutions with grouped convolutions with group-width equal to eight to fully utilize the NVIDIA tensor core 16m x 8n x 8k matrix multiply instruction. Block fusion replaces a sequence of low operational intensity, degenrate conv2d layers with a single, high operational intensity kernel. Block fusion algorithms create temporal locality, reduce workspace size, and avoid communication to DRAM.

Our block-fusion kernels run 3x to 14x faster than PyTorch Inductor kernels on an NVIDIA Ampere A5000 GPU with float16 tensor core arithmetic. We implemented MBConv with Squeeze & Excitation (MBConv+SE), the block which created the impressive model efficiency of EfficientNet. We also implemented a new block, ConvFirst, which is very similar to ConvNeXt, but better suited for tensor-core arithmetic.

(An aside: I created the ConvFirst block in 2019, but did not publish it until now due to engineering workload. ConvNeXt was discovered independently).

In the final chapter, we created a new convnet called ConvFirstNet using ConvFirst blocks in the early stages and MBConv+SE block in the late stages. This separation between light-weight blocks for early vision and heavy blocks for late vision was used in EfficientNetV2. Our ConvFirst block is a light-weight alternative to the FusedMBConvBlock used by EfficientNetV2, producing better model efficiency.

The result is that ConvFirstNet has better model efficiency than EfficientNet and better computational efficiency than ConvNeXt. Using our kernels, ConvFirstNet runs 4x as fast as ConvNeXt using PyTorch Inductor. In fact, the actual latency of ConvFirstNet is less than ideal latency of ConvNeXt.

I hope that this work contributes to the progress of model efficiency research. I look forward to all of the wonderful applications of efficient convnets.",1,1

We establish that linear attention Transformers with ReLU layers can approximate second order optimization algorithms for the task of logistic regression and achieve ϵ error with only a logarithmic to the error more layers. As a by-product we demonstrate the ability of even linear attention-only Transformers in implementing a single step of Newton's iteration for matrix inversion with merely two layers.

I think I figured out how to do self-attention in transformer models in O(NlogN) computation steps rather than O(N\^2), with a caveat. I'm not trying to be an academic, so I don't care to publish this formally, but I thought that some people might be interested. My construction is not efficient or practical, but the fact that it can be done at all might motivate further work to find efficient alternatives.

tl;dr Use the parallel scan\[1\] technique to compute taylor series basis functions needed to compute the causal self-attention layer and sum these together weighted by the values vector and 1 to get the numerator and denominator of the softmax activation of the full causal self-attention layer. The basis functions that you have to compute are both the basis functions for the numerator of the self-attention layer, $$\\sum\_{i=0}\^{j-1} k(i)\_a\^n q(j)\_b\^m v(i)$$ and the normalization $\\sum\_{i=0}\^{j-1} k(i)\_a\^n q(j)\_b\^m$. k(i)\_a\^n is component-a of the ith key vector raised to the power of n multiplied by q(j)\_b\^m which is component-b of the jth query vector raised to the power of m, which is multiplied by the value vector at position i in the first equation and by 1 in the second, and all summed together. Once you can do this, you've computed a basis function for a Taylor series. Multiply each basis function by a coefficient and sum them together to create an arbitrary function of k(i) and q(j). Using this technique, we can compute the Taylor series approximation for the numerator and the denominator of the softmax activation each taking logN \* {number of coefficients} parallel steps, or O(N) sequential steps by treating the accumulation as a type of RNN.

# Background

I was inspired to think about this because I was implementing MAMBA\[2\] and trying to understand what kind of non-linearities can be created using the parallel scan technique. The parallel scan technique is a way of parallelizing recursive formulas. If you don't know what parallel scan is, let me demonstrate with an example. The simplest example of the parallel scan technique is computing all partial sums of a sequence of numbers in log(N) time. Imagine you have a sequence \[a\_1, a\_2, a\_3, a\_4, ...\]. You can compute all partial sums by first adding a\_i to a\_{i -1}, where a\_{-1} is zero, and generally a\_{-n} is defined to be zero. Then take the result, call it r = \[a\_1, a\_1+a\_2, a\_2 + a\_3, ...\], and compute r\_i + r\_{i-2}, which gives \[a\_1, a\_1+a\_2, a\_1+a\_2+a\_3, ...\]. The first 4 partial sums are already complete. The next step would be r\_i + r\_{i-2\*\*2}, and the next step, just increase the power of 2 until i-2\*\*power is negative for every i in the sequence. It basically sums groups, and then sums those groups together, and so on and so forth until the partial sum at each position is calculated.  The scan technique is a way to parallelize an RNN. Essentially, you remove some nonlinearities in the RNN so that recurrence equation becomes associative. Once it is associative, you can compute the hidden state at each position of the sequence in log N parallel steps, where each parallel step has O(N) parallel computations.

# The Meat of It

In the background section, I explained how to compute a partial sum in O(log(N)) time and O(NlogN) computation steps (or O(N) time and O(N) computation steps by using RNNs) using the parallel scan technique. I'll use this now to construct the Taylor series for causal self-attention layer used in transformer models.

Let's assume we have a tensor x of shape (sequence\_length, embedding\_dim), and we can compute the query, key and value tensors from x using q=Qx, k=Kx and v=Vx, where Q, K and V are matrices. Compute y = (k\[:,i\]\*\*n)\*v. Now use the parallel scan technique to accumulate the partial sums of every vector in y, which will give ParallelPartialSum(y)=\[y\[0,:\], y\[0,:\]+y\[1,:\], ...\]. Now multiply the result by q\[:,j\]\*\*m, and now we have a basis function for a Taylor series expansion. The full formula is q\[:,j\]\*\*m \* ParallelPartialSum((k\[:,i\]\*\*n)\*v). Next, we can add up these functions for different powers of n and m using coefficients to approximate any function. The final equation is \\sum\_{n, m} A\_{n, m} q\[:,j\]\*\*m \* ParallelPartialSum((k\[:,i\]\*\*n)\*v).

What is left is to find the Taylor series coefficients A\_{n, m} and to calculate the normalization for the softmax. I'm not actually going to give an equation for A\_{n, m}, but I will show that it can be done. First, I'm just going to write $q \\cdot k$ in place of $q\[:,j,:\] \\cdot k\[:,i,:\]$ to make it easier to write and read. We want the Taylor series of $exp(q \\cdot k) = 1 + (q \\cdot k) + (q \\cdot k)\*\*2 / 2! + ... + (q \\cdot k)\*\*n / n! + ...$. To find the Taylor series coefficient for every component of q and component of k and every power of each, you'd have to expand out (q \\cdot k)\*\*n /n! for every n. It can be done but I'm not going to do it. Just assume that A\_{n, m} is equal to these coefficients, and voila, we have the numerator of the softmax equation for self-attention. We still need the denominator. To compute the denominator of the softmax over attention scores, you compute the same sum replacing the value tensor with the number 1. $\\sum\_{n, m} A\_{n, m} x\[:,j\]\*\*m \* ParallelPartialSum((x\[:,i\]\*\*n))$, where again the value vector at the end of the equation is removed. The final equation for the causal self-attention layer is:

$$  
(\\sum\_{n, m} A\_{n, m} q\[:,j\]\*\*m \* ParallelPartialSum((k\[:,i\]\*\*n)\*v)) / (\\sum\_{n, m} A\_{n, m} q\[:,j\]\*\*m \* ParallelPartialSum((k\[:,i\]\*\*n)))  
$$

Where again, A\_{n, m} are the Taylor series coefficients for exp( q \\cdot k).

# Take-Aways

One big take away from this work, is that since causal self-attention can be calculated using the parallel scan technique, and since a parallel scan can be computed with an RNN, it follows that full causal self-attention can be computed with RNNs. The caveat is that you need many RNNs, one for each Taylor series basis function, so to get a good enough approximation of the softmax activation, you'd probably need a lot of coefficients, more than would be practical. On the other hand, what if there is a related activation that does the job of the softmax, but can be constructed with far fewer parallel scans? Then full causal self-attention could be done using only a few RNNs. Also, there are other basis functions that can be computed with one parallel scan, for instance, basis functions for a Fourier series can be computed with one parallel scan.

Non-linear activations are necessary for neural networks to work well. Linear RNNs can be parallelized using parallel scans, and since it is a linear function, one might think that this technique is not as powerful as other neural network layers. One shouldn't make the mistake to think that only linear RNN can be parallelized with linear scans. Non-linear RNNs can also be parallelized so long as the recursive update rule is associative. One might think that this restriction somehow makes the model weaker, I did, at first. But if associative recursion formulas are enough to create transformers(albeit inefficiently), then it stands to reason that they can do anything a transformer can, which is a lot. The only question is whether it's possible to come up with an efficient activation. Maybe MAMBA already did, maybe there is something better.

# Update

Actually there is a better algorithm for the parallel scan given in the wiki link above\[1\]. That means that causal self-attention can be calculated with O(log N) time and O(N) steps instead of O(NlogN) steps.

# Update 2

@[Lajamerr\_Mittesdine](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lajamerr_Mittesdine/) Started some code to implement the algorithm in a comment below. I made some changes to it, and the result is below. Thanks @[Lajamerr\_Mittesdine](https://www.reddit.com/user/Lajamerr_Mittesdine/)! Also, I want to reiterate that this is not meant to be an efficient or practical implementation of the self-attention. Each taylor series basis function takes logN time and NlogN computation, but you would need a lot of basis functions to properly approximate the softmax of attention scores. Alternatively, the algorithm can be ran in recursive mode, which turns it into an RNN that runs in O(N) steps. This is more to show that self-attention can be implemented as many RNNs running in parallel. To make this efficient, a different formula for self-attention would have to be used, not the softmax of the dot product of queries and keys, but something else that can be computed with few parallel scans.

We're happy to share LinearBoost, our latest development in machine learning classification algorithms. LinearBoost is based on boosting a linear classifier to significantly enhance performance. Our testing shows it outperforms traditional GBDT algorithms in terms of accuracy and response time across five well-known datasets.  
The key to LinearBoost's enhanced performance lies in its approach at each estimator stage. Unlike decision trees used in GBDTs, which select features sequentially, LinearBoost utilizes a linear classifier as its building block, considering all available features simultaneously. This comprehensive feature integration allows for more robust decision-making processes at every step.

We believe LinearBoost can be a valuable tool for both academic research and real-world applications. Check out our results and code in our GitHub repo: [https://github.com/LinearBoost/linearboost-classifier](https://github.com/LinearBoost/linearboost-classifier) . The algorithm is in its infancy and has certain limitations as reported in the GitHub repo, but we are working on them in future plans.

MachineLearning,t3_1cqq1in,1715572047.0,/r/MachineLearning/comments/1cqq1in/d_thoughts_on_dspy/,Discussion,[D] Thoughts on DSPy,"I have been tinkering with DSPy and thought I will share my 2 cents here for anyone who is planning to explore it:

The core idea behind DSPy are two things:

1.	⁠Separate programming from prompting
2.	⁠incorporate some of the best practice prompting techniques under the hood and expose it as a “signature”

Imagine working on a RAG. Today, the typical approach is to write some retrieval and pass the results to a language model for natural language generation. But, after the first pass, you realize it’s not perfect and you need to iterate and improve it. Typically, there are 2 levers to pull:

1.	⁠Document Chunking, insertion and Retrieval strategy
2.	⁠Language model settings and prompt engineering

Now, you try a few things, maybe document the performance in a google sheet, iterate and arrive at an ideal set of variables that gives max accuracy.

Now, let’s say after a month, model upgrades, and all of a sudden the accuracy of your RAG regresses. Again you are back to square one, cos you don’t know what to optimize now - retrieval or model? You see what the problem is with this approach? This is a very open ended, monolithic, brittle and unstructured way to optimize and build language model based applications.

This is precisely the problem DSPy is trying to solve. Whatever you can achieve with DSPy can be achieved with native prompt engineering and program composition techniques but it is purely dependent on the programmers skill. But DSPy provides native constructs which anyone can learn and use for trying different techniques in a systematic manner.

DSPy the concept:

Separate prompting from programming and signatures

DSPy does not do any magic with the language model. It just uses a bunch of prompt templates behind the scenes and exposes them as signatures. Ex: when you write a signature like ‘context, question -> answer’, DSPy adds a typical RAG prompt before it makes the call to the LLM. But DSPy also gives you nice features like module settings, assertion based backtracking and automatic prompt optimization.

Basically, you can do something like this with DSPy,

“Given a context and question, answer the following question. Make sure the answer is only “yes” or “no””. If the language model responds with anything else, traditionally we prompt engineer our way to fix it. In DSPy, you can assert the answer for “yes” or “no” and if the assertion fails, DSPy will backtrack automatically, update the prompt to say something like, “this is not a correct answer- {previous_answer} and always only respond with a “yes” or “no”” and makes another language model call which improves the LLMs response because of this newly optimized prompt. In addition, you can also incorporate things like multi hops in your retrieval where you can do something like “retrieve -> generate queries and then retrieve again using the generated queries” for n times and build up a larger context to answer the original question.

Obviously, this can also be done using usual prompt engineering and programming techniques, but the framework exposes native easy to use settings and constructs to do these things more naturally. DSPy as a concept really shines when you are composing a pipeline of language model calls where prompt engineering the entire pipeline or even module wise can lead to a brittle Pipeline.

DSPy the Framework:

Now coming to the framework which is built in python, I think the framework as it stands today is

1.	⁠Not production ready
2.	⁠Lacks clear documentation
3.	⁠Poorly designed with not so clean interfaces and abstractions

To me it felt like a rushed implementation with little thought for design thinking, testing and programming principles. The framework code is very hard to understand with a lot of meta programming and data structure parsing and construction going behind the scenes that are scary to run in production.

This is a huge deterrent for anyone trying to learn and use this framework. But, I am sure the creators are thinking about all this and are working to reengineer the framework. There’s also a typescript implementation of this framework that is fairly less popular but has a much better and cleaner design and codebase:

https://github.com/dosco/llm-client/

My final thought about this framework is, it’s a promising concept, but it does not change anything about what we already know about LLMs. Also, hiding prompts as templates does not mean prompt engineering is going away, someone still needs to “engineer” the prompts the framework uses and imo the framework should expose these templates and give control back to the developers that way, the vision of separate programming and prompting co exists with giving control not only to program but also to prompt.

Finally, I was able to understand all this by running DSPy programs and visualizing the LLM calls and what prompts it’s adding using my open source tool - https://github.com/Scale3-Labs/langtrace . Do check it out and let me know if you have any feedback.",1,16

Sharing my side project here: [https://github.com/andylolu2/simpleGEMM](https://github.com/andylolu2/simpleGEMM) !

This is an *extremely* minimalistic but fast implementation of matrix multiplication in CUDA. The source code is a single, 200-line CUDA/C++ file which implements fp16 tensor core matrix multiplication, optimised for Turing (SM75) architecture. The goal is to:

1. Write a matmul kernel that does not sacrifice performance. In fact, it's faster than PyTorch/CuBLAS if you [test it on a T4 in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/andylolu2/simpleGEMM/blob/master/colab/simpleGEMM.ipynb)!
2. Make it hackable for new purposes. For example if you want to add a new custom prologue (e.g. Matmul + some reduction), just go to line 186, add your code, and recompile! Full flexibility with no C++ templating shenanigans.
3. Keep it as simple as possible. Hopefully someone learning CUDA will find this useful!

Of course, I didn't implement *everything* from scratch. Most of the this builds upon Nvidia CUTLASS's new CuTe interface for things like memory layout, data copying and using tensor core instructions.

*Aside:*

*Why not OpenAI Triton? I love triton, but sometimes it's hard to get the extra 10-20% performance if you are doing something off its main optimisation path. In fact,* [*triton's matmul for Turing GPUs is quite slow*](https://github.com/openai/triton/issues/189) *(because they mainly optimise for SM80+). I just enjoy having full control over the hardware, knowing that if I have infinite time I can squeeze very single bit of performance out.*",3,44

>In this report, we introduce **InternVL 1.5**, an open-source multimodal large language model (MLLM) to bridge the capability gap between open-source and proprietary commercial models in multimodal understanding. We introduce three simple improvements: (1) Strong Vision Encoder: we explored a continuous learning strategy for the large-scale vision foundation model -- InternViT-6B, boosting its visual understanding capabilities, and making it can be transferred and reused in different LLMs. (2) Dynamic High-Resolution: we divide images into tiles ranging from 1 to 40 of 448×448 pixels according to the aspect ratio and resolution of the input images, which supports up to 4K resolution input. (3) High-Quality Bilingual Dataset: we carefully collected a high-quality bilingual dataset that covers common scenes, document images, and annotated them with English and Chinese question-answer pairs, significantly enhancing performance in OCR- and Chinese-related tasks. We evaluate InternVL 1.5 through a series of benchmarks and comparative studies. Compared to both open-source and proprietary models, InternVL 1.5 shows competitive performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in 8 of 18 benchmarks.

**Abstract**:

>We present a novel approach to accelerate stochastic gradient descent (SGD) by utilizing curvature information obtained from Hessian-vector products or finite differences of parameters and gradients, similar to the BFGS algorithm. Our approach involves two preconditioners: a matrix-free preconditioner and a low-rank approximation preconditioner. We update both preconditioners online using a criterion that is robust to stochastic gradient noise and does not require line search or damping. To preserve the corresponding symmetry or invariance, our preconditioners are constrained to certain connected Lie groups. The Lie group's equivariance property simplifies the preconditioner fitting process, while its invariance property eliminates the need for damping, which is commonly required in second-order optimizers. As a result, the learning rate for parameter updating and the step size for preconditioner fitting are naturally normalized, and their default values work well in most scenarios. Our proposed approach offers a promising direction for improving the convergence of SGD with low computational overhead. We demonstrate that **Preconditioned SGD** (**PSGD**) outperforms SoTA on Vision, NLP, and RL tasks across multiple modern deep-learning architectures. We have provided code for reproducing toy and large scale experiments in this paper.",0,14

I have been reading through unet pytorch implementations here https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch but I do not yet understand how a pixel in the process of denoising ever „knows“ its (relative) position in the image. While the amount of noise is conditioned on each pixel using embedding of the time Parameter, this is not done for the spatial position?

So when denoising an image of the cat starting from pure noise, what makes the unet create the head of the cat on the top and the feet at the bottom of the image? Or denoising portraits, the hair is on top and the neck at the bottom?

I think the convolution kernels might maintain local spatial coherence within their sphere of influence, but this feels „not enough“. 

Neither is the input image downsampled into the size of the innermost convolution kernels. In the referred code examples, they sample a128x128 into 8x8 on bottom layer. This is then again 3-convoluted, so not covering the entire area.

So How can the unet achieve spatial consistency/spatial  auto-conditioning?

Thanks",19,17

The KL Divergence between two distributions p and q is defined as : `$D_{KL}(p || q) = E_{p}[\log \frac{p}{q}]$`

depending on the order of p and q, the divergence is mode seeking or mode covering.

However, can one use `$\frac{-1}{D_{KL}(p || q)}$` as a divergence metric?

Or maybe not a divergence metric (strictly speaking), but something to measure similarity/dissimilarity between the two distributions?

**Edit**:

it is definitely not a divergence as `-1/KL(p,q) <= 0` also as pointed in the discussion, `1/KL(p,p) = +oo`.

However, I am thinking it from this point: if `KL(p,q)` is decreasing `=>` `1/KL(p,q)` is increasing `=>` `-1/KL(p,q)` is decreasing. Although, `-1/KL(p,q)` is unbounded from below hence can reach `-oo`. Question is, does the above equivalence, make `-1/KL(p,q)` useful as a metric for any application. Or is it considered somewhere in any literature.",5,7

So I was trying to re-produce this paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12262](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12262)

However, I got stuck on a certain function that I don't understand. Specifically, the ""quantizer"" *h,* in Equation 6 shared below:

https://preview.redd.it/ykotdlvjwuzc1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d5d6a9e35414ee65f1609a2508864719431c8a

Firstly: I don't understand what ""soft codewords distribution"" means. Do they mean they passed the output features through a softmax first? If so, then why is there an EMA *h()* if h() is just a softmax.

They cite iBOT so they could mean two things: The iBOT head (which is just MLP layers) or the centering/sharpening + softmax in the iBOT loss. If they mean the former, then why do they have the decoder in equation 5? Only the student outputs go through the decoder, as highlighted in their figure 1. If they mean the centering/sharpening + softmax thing from the iBOT loss, then why do they describe the quantizer as ""online"" which implies that it is trainable.

The code is not public, and I did try to contact the authors about something else before, but didn't get any reply.

Any ideas or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

The data I will be using is provided by an institution and although it is somewhat outdated (from the year 2021), it can be used for the objectives of my project.

To have a better idea of everything described so far, what I aim to achieve with my development is as follows:



a. Review and select appropriate artificial intelligence techniques for fraud analysis in credit cards.

b. Implement various predictive models to identify fraud patterns.

c. Evaluate and compare the accuracy and efficiency of each model using a sample of real data.

d. Recommend the most effective model or models for practical implementation, based on criteria of accuracy, processing speed, and ease of integration into existing systems.

e. Propose improvements in fraud detection processes based on the results obtained.



Based on this, I have the following questions to know if I am meeting the objectives so far:

1. After getting an idea of the project and visualizing the data, did I approach it correctly or should I give it another focus, and if so, what would you recommend?

2. Is the way the data was processed correct?

3. For the selection of the most impactful features for my model, I used the Recursive Feature Elimination technique. For the type of problem I want to address, can this technique be applied, or should I implement another one that is perhaps more robust?

4. Regarding the selection of models, do you recommend any others that may help and have more relevance and impact on my solution? Do the ways in which I evaluated them and the results obtained seem logical to you? Do you think they could be applied in institutions? What would be missing for them to be considered and applied to real situations?

I also want to know the correct ways to test the model since I tried creating a synthetic dataset with characteristics similar to the one I have, called ""synthetic data,"" but as it is under the same conditions as the original (unbalanced and untreated data), I have no idea how to do it. Although I found on a website that using a pipeline could do it, I'm not convinced by that.

Any other observations or contributions outside of everything mentioned are welcome as well.

I am not planning on rerunning the experiments of the other works because I don't have the compute, nor time. But I will still be comparing my results with theirs, and for that I will have to follow the training configurations used in those works.

The problem is different papers report different configurations, although they are comparing their results with each other. The paper that other methods usually compare themselves with is the [MI-AOD - CVPR21](https://github.com/yuantn/MI-AOD) paper, since it is the first AL method for object detection in CVPR. For RetinaNet, they train 26 epochs with LR of 0.001, stepping by 0.1 at epoch 20.

Then comes the [CVPR22 ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07965)paper which uses the standard 1x schedule for RetinaNet training (12 epochs, 0.02 LR, and steps at epoch 8 and 11). Yet, they're comparing their results with the MI-AOD paper and it doesn't seem like they rerun the experiments with their settings because the mAP looks exactly the same as the one reported in the original. I can only judge it by looks because they only show the comparison as plots of mAP in each AL cycle and don't write down the values in the table. They also don't have the code published.

Then you have [PPAL - CVPR24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11612) that claims to use the same config as MI-AOD, [but in their code](https://github.com/ChenhongyiYang/PPAL/blob/15875ed7a524675bc6daeba79b3716a0abca2b64/configs/voc_active_learning/al_train/retinanet_26e.py#L22) they're using an LR of 0.002 instead of 0.001 like they claim in the paper. And they also compare their results with the last two, despite differing configs and it doesn't seem like they rerun the experiments here either (again plots only, no table).

There are also several other works outside of CVPR, and they usually tend to follow the MI-AOD settings.

My question is, since the above three are all in CVPR, I would be required to at least compare my method with theirs, but how do I decide what config to use? Do I just follow the latest CVPR one as reported in their paper and use their reported results for the previous works for comparison?",7,10

The main goal of UAI is to develop a mathematical theory for combining sequential prediction (which seeks to predict the distribution of the next observation) together with action (which seeks to maximize expected reward), since these are among the problems that intelligent agents face when interacting in an unknown environment. Solomonoff induction provides a universal approach to sequence prediction in that it constructs an optimal prior (in a certain sense) over the space of all computable distributions of sequences, thus enabling Bayesian updating to enable convergence to the true predictive distribution (assuming the latter is computable). Combining Solomonoff induction with optimal action leads us to an agent known as AIXI, which in this theoretical setting, can be argued to be a mathematical incarnation of artificial general intelligence (AGI): it is an agent which acts optimally in general, unknown environments. More generally, Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter have proposed a definition of ""universal intelligence"" in their paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3329)

**Abstract**:

>Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict *multiple* future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.",4,17

*Timothée Darcet, Maxime Oquab, Julien Mairal, Piotr Bojanowski*

**Abstract:** Transformers have recently emerged as a powerful tool for learning visual representations. In this paper, we identify and characterize artifacts in feature maps of both supervised and self-supervised ViT networks. The artifacts correspond to high-norm tokens appearing during inference primarily in low-informative background areas of images, that are repurposed for internal computations. We propose a simple yet effective solution based on providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer to fill that role. We show that this solution fixes that problem entirely for both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models on dense visual prediction tasks, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and most importantly leads to smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing.

[**Generalization in diffusion models arises from geometry-adaptive harmonic representations**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ANvmVS2Yr0)  
*Zahra Kadkhodaie, Florentin Guth, Eero P Simoncelli, Stéphane Mallat*

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained for image denoising are able to generate high-quality samples with score-based reverse diffusion algorithms. These impressive capabilities seem to imply an escape from the curse of dimensionality, but recent reports of memorization of the training set raise the question of whether these networks are learning the “true” continuous density of the data. Here, we show that two DNNs trained on non-overlapping subsets of a dataset learn nearly the same score function, and thus the same density, when the number of training images is large enough. In this regime of strong generalization, diffusion-generated images are distinct from the training set, and are of high visual quality, suggesting that the inductive biases of the DNNs are well-aligned with the data density. We analyze the learned denoising functions and show that the inductive biases give rise to a shrinkage operation in a basis adapted to the underlying image. Examination of these bases reveals oscillating harmonic structures along contours and in homogeneous regions. We demonstrate that trained denoisers are inductively biased towards these geometry-adaptive harmonic bases since they arise not only when the network is trained on photographic images, but also when it is trained on image classes supported on low-dimensional manifolds for which the harmonic basis is suboptimal. Finally, we show that when trained on regular image classes for which the optimal basis is known to be geometry-adaptive and harmonic, the denoising performance of the networks is near-optimal.

**Abstract:** Generative models trained on internet data have revolutionized how text, image, and video content can be created. Perhaps the next milestone for generative models is to simulate realistic experience in response to actions taken by humans, robots, and other interactive agents. Applications of a real-world simulator range from controllable content creation in games and movies, to training embodied agents purely in simulation that can be directly deployed in the real world. We explore the possibility of learning a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world interaction through generative modeling. We first make the important observation that natural datasets available for learning a real-world simulator are often rich along different axes (e.g., abundant objects in image data, densely sampled actions in robotics data, and diverse movements in navigation data). With careful orchestration of diverse datasets, each providing a different aspect of the overall experience, UniSim can emulate how humans and agents interact with the world by simulating the visual outcome of both high-level instructions such as “open the drawer” and low-level controls such as “move by x,y” from otherwise static scenes and objects. There are numerous use cases for such a real-world simulator. As an example, we use UniSim to train both high-level vision-language planners and low-level reinforcement learning policies, each of which exhibit zero-shot real-world transfer after training purely in a learned real-world simulator. We also show that other types of intelligence such as video captioning models can benefit from training with simulated experience in UniSim, opening up even wider applications.

[**Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PdaPky8MUn)  
*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*

**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using only the downstream task data, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.",8,130

**EDIT:** You all gave me some good leads; I think I have found a plausible answer: It likely comes from cognitive psychology. The [paper introducing the perceptron](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1959-09865-001) (arguably the first step towards neural networks) refers to inputs as stimuli, but also notes that encoding stimuli into a small set of robust features helps performance:

>As the number of responses in the system increases, the performance becomes progressively poorer, if every response is made mutually exclusive of all alternatives. One method of avoiding this deterioration (described in detail in Rosenblatt, 15) is through the binary coding of responses. In this case, i**nstead of representing 100 different stimulus patterns by 100 distinct, mutually exclusive responses, a limited number of discriminating features is found, each of which can be independently recognized as being present or absent**, and consequently can be represented by a single pair of mutually exclusive responses.

(highlighting is mine)

And later it concludes

>The performance of the system can be improved by the use of a contour-sensitive projection area, and by the use of a binary response system, in which **each response, or ""bit,"" corresponds to some independent feature or attribute of the stimulus**.

**Abstract**:

>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially enhanced their mathematical reasoning abilities. However, these models still struggle with complex problems that require multiple reasoning steps, frequently leading to logical or numerical errors. While numerical mistakes can largely be addressed by integrating a code interpreter, identifying logical errors within intermediate steps is more challenging. Moreover, manually annotating these steps for training is not only expensive but also demands specialized expertise. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach that eliminates the need for manual annotation by leveraging the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to generate both the process supervision and evaluation signals automatically. Essentially, when a LLM is well pre-trained, only the mathematical questions and their final answers are required to generate our training data, without requiring the solutions. We proceed to train a step-level value model designed to improve the LLM's inference process in mathematical domains. Our experiments indicate that using automatically generated solutions by LLMs enhanced with MCTS significantly improves the model's proficiency in dealing with intricate mathematical reasoning tasks.",0,19

Husky AI dynamically incorporates real-time data from the web and its local ElasticSearch DB, significantly expanding its knowledge base and contextual understanding. The system's ability to continuously learn and refine its response generation capabilities through user interactions sets a new standard in the development of generative AI systems. Husky AI's superior performance, real-time knowledge integration, and generalizability across applications position it as a paradigm shift in the field, paving the way for the future of intelligent systems.

Husky AI Architecture: A Symphony of AIL Components

At the heart of Husky AI's success lies its innovative architecture, which seamlessly integrates various AIL components to achieve its cutting-edge capabilities. Let's dive into the core elements that make Husky AI a game-changer:

2.1. Intelligent Data Manipulation: Streamlining Information Processing

Husky AI's foundation is built upon intelligent data manipulation techniques that ensure efficient storage, retrieval, and processing of information. The system employs state-of-the-art sentence transformers to convert structured & unstructured textual data into dense vector representations, known as embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning and relationships within the data, enabling precise similarity searches during information retrieval.

Under the hood, the preprocess\_and\_write\_data function works its magic. It ingests raw data, encodes it as a text string, and feeds it to the sentence transformer model. The resulting embeddings are then stored alongside the data within a Document object, which is subsequently committed to the document store for efficient retrieval.

2.2. Dynamic Context-Aware Retrieval: The Mastermind of Relevance

Husky AI takes information retrieval to the next level with its dynamic context-aware retrieval mechanism. The MultiModalRetriever class, in seamless integration with Elasticsearch (ESDB), serves as the mastermind behind this operation, ensuring lightning-fast indexing and retrieval.

When a user query arrives, the MultiModalRetriever springs into action. It generates a query embedding and performs a similarity search against the document embeddings stored within Elasticsearch. The similarity function meticulously calculates the semantic proximity between the query and document embeddings, identifying the most relevant documents based on their similarity scores. This approach ensures that Husky AI stays in sync with the evolving conversation context, retrieving the most pertinent information at each turn. The result is a system that generates responses that are not only accurate but also exhibit remarkable coherence and contextual relevance.

2.3. Ensemble of Specialized Language Models: A Symphony of Expertise

Husky AI takes response generation to new heights by employing an ensemble of specialized language models, orchestrated by the MultiModelAgent class. Each model within the ensemble is meticulously trained for specific tasks or domains, contributing its unique expertise to the response generation process.

When a user query is received, the MultiModelAgent leverages the retrieved documents and conversation context to generate responses from each language model in the ensemble. These individual responses are then carefully combined and processed to select the optimal response, taking into account factors such as relevance, coherence, and factual accuracy. By harnessing the strengths of specialized models like BlenderbotConversationalAgent, HFConversationalModel, and MyConversationalAgent, Husky AI can handle a wide range of topics and generate responses tailored to specific domains or tasks.

2.4. Integration of CustomWebRetriever: The Game Changer

Husky AI takes adaptability and knowledge expansion to new heights with the integration of the CustomWebRetriever class. This powerful tool enables the system to dynamically retrieve and incorporate external data from the web, significantly expanding Husky AI's knowledge base and enhancing its contextual understanding by providing access to real-time information.

Under the hood, the CustomWebRetriever class leverages the Serper API to conduct web searches and retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. It generates query embeddings using sentence transformers and utilizes these embeddings to ensure that the retrieved information aligns closely with the user's intent.

The impact of the CustomWebRetriever on Husky AI's knowledge acquisition is profound. By incorporating this component into its pipeline, Husky AI gains access to a vast reservoir of external knowledge. It can retrieve up-to-date information from the web and dynamically adapt to new domains and topics. This dynamic knowledge evolution empowers Husky AI to handle a broader spectrum of information needs and provide accurate and relevant responses, even for niche or evolving topics.

Iterative Learning: The Continuous Improvement Engine

One of the key strengths of Husky AI lies in its ability to learn and improve over time through iterative learning. The system's knowledge base and response generation capabilities are continuously refined based on user interactions, ensuring a constantly evolving and adapting AI.

3.1. Learning from Interactions

With every user interaction, Husky AI diligently analyzes the conversation history, user feedback (implicit or explicit), and the effectiveness of the chosen response. This analysis provides invaluable insights that help the system refine its understanding of user intent, identify areas for improvement, and strengthen its knowledge base.

3.2. Refining Response Generation

The insights gleaned from user interactions are then used to refine the response generation process. Husky AI can dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different language models within the ensemble, prioritize specific information retrieval strategies, and optimize the response selection criteria based on user feedback. This continuous learning cycle ensures that Husky AI's responses become progressively more accurate, coherent, and user-centric over time.

3.3. Adaptability Across Applications

The iterative learning mechanism in Husky AI fosters generalizability, enabling the system to adapt to diverse applications. As Husky AI encounters new domains, topics, and user interaction patterns, it can refine its knowledge and response generation strategies accordingly. This adaptability makes Husky AI a valuable tool for a wide range of use cases, from customer support and virtual assistants to content generation and knowledge management.

4. Experimental Results and Analysis While traditional evaluation metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of generative AI systems, they may not fully capture the unique strengths and capabilities of Husky AI's AIL-powered architecture. The system's ability to dynamically acquire knowledge, continuously learn through user interactions, and leverage the synergy of its components presents challenges for conventional evaluation methods.  
4.1. The Limitations of Traditional Metrics Traditional evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score, are designed to assess the performance of individual components or specific tasks. However, Husky AI's true potential lies in the seamless integration and collaboration of its various modules. Attempting to evaluate Husky AI using isolated metrics would be like judging a symphony by focusing on individual instruments rather than appreciating the harmonious performance of the entire orchestra. Moreover, traditional metrics may not adequately account for Husky AI's ability to continuously learn and update its knowledge base through the \`CustomWebRetriever\`. The system's dynamic knowledge acquisition capabilities enable it to adapt to new domains and provide accurate responses to previously unseen topics. This ongoing learning process, driven by user interactions, is a progressive feature that may not be fully reflected in conventional evaluation methods.  
4.2. Showcasing Husky AI's Strengths through Real-World Scenarios To truly showcase Husky AI's superior capabilities, it is essential to evaluate the system in real-world scenarios that highlight its adaptability, contextual relevance, and continuous learning. By engaging Husky AI in diverse conversational contexts and assessing its performance over time, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of its strengths and potential.  
4.2.1. Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition and Adaptation To demonstrate Husky AI's dynamic knowledge acquisition capabilities, the system can be exposed to new domains and topics in real-time. By observing how quickly and effectively Husky AI retrieves and incorporates relevant information from the web, we can assess its ability to adapt to evolving knowledge landscapes. This showcases the power of the \`CustomWebRetriever\` in expanding Husky AI's knowledge base and enhancing its contextual understanding.  
4.2.2. Continuous Learning through User Interactions Husky AI's continuous learning capabilities can be evaluated by engaging the system in extended conversational sessions with users. By analyzing how Husky AI refines its responses, improves its understanding of user intent, and adapts to individual preferences over time, we can demonstrate the effectiveness of its iterative learning mechanism. This highlights the system's ability to learn from user feedback and deliver increasingly personalized and relevant responses.  
4.2.3. Contextual Relevance and Coherence To assess Husky AI's contextual relevance and coherence, the system can be evaluated in real-world conversational scenarios that require a deep understanding of context and the ability to maintain a coherent dialogue. By engaging Husky AI in multi-turn conversations spanning various topics and domains, we can demonstrate its ability to generate accurate, contextually relevant, and coherent responses. This showcases the power of the ensemble model and the synergy between the system's components. Husky AI sets a new standard for intelligent, adaptable, and user-centric systems. Its AIL-powered architecture paves the way for the development of AI systems that can seamlessly integrate with the dynamic nature of real-world knowledge and meet the diverse needs of users. With its continuous learning capabilities and real-time knowledge acquisition, Husky AI represents a significant step forward in the quest for truly intelligent and responsive AI systems.

We are here to share our latest work: consistency large language models (CLLMs), which is a new family of models capable of reducing inference latency by efficiently decoding 𝑛 tokens in parallel. Your new friends for LLM serving/local deployment with faster inference speed! 🔥 Please check our blog post for demo with 3.1x speedup:

[https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/cllm/](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/cllm/)

Compared with existing fast decoding techniques, CLLMs achieve fast parallel decoding **without the need for**:

* Draft models
* Architectural modifications/auxiliary model components

This introduces a number of advantages for CLLMs:

* CLLMs don't have to deal with the complexity of obtaining 'good' draft models and managing two different models in a single system.
* CLLMs share the same architecture with target LLMs and require no additional engineering efforts when adopting the technique to different models.
* CLLMs can be integrated seamlessly with other techniques for efficient LLM inference (e.g. Lookahead Decoding) to achieve even more significant speedup.

This decoding method CLLMs use is called [Jacobi decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10427), which improves inference efficiency in comparison with conventional auto-regressive decoding. CLLMs are trained with the objective of performing efficient Jacobi decoding by mapping any randomly initialized 𝑛-token sequence to the same result as AR decoding in as few steps as possible.

Experiment results have demonstrated the effectiveness of CLLMs, showing 2.4× to 3.4× improvements in generation speed on a variety of tasks.

[In comparison with Medusa2, CLLMs achieve comparable or better performance, but \*\*need no extra parameters or tree-style verification\*\*](https://preview.redd.it/fta39wapq9zc1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=af39917a635c57a3d8886f8db3a952c0716909c9)

But folk knowledge is that a transformer trained for a single epoch can recall facts that only appear a single time in the training dataset. This implies that a single update is enough to modify the weights to produce the correct output (without catastrophically forgetting other facts).

This is really surprising to me. I would think a single update large enough to substantially modify an output would be quite destructive, and possibly just not do what you want given the non-monotonicity of the loss landscape.

At the end of the day, I will have one model, a prediction and a ground truth (which may or not be known to me). Which method should I be looking at to explain a given prediction?

I'm currently doing a comparative analysis of different XAI methods for tabular data from the perspective of practicality and clarity for the users.

Among other things, I want to consider robustness of the method (does it work for different types of models and different data domains?), and interpretability of the explanation itself (how easy is it to understand and communicate the explanation itself to non-technical users). From this, I'm also wondering, is there a way to measure the quality (or applicability) of the explanation? That is, how would I know if the explanation I'm looking at actually makes sense/if I'm using the right method for a given use case? Although the example above relates to computer vision, I suspect I will find similar issues in the case of tabular data.

In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.

    Answer: Apples, Oranges

The answer shown above being simply the expected answer. If we were to use prompts, some other possibilities would be \[Apple, Orange\], \[Oranges, Apples\] etc.

In my case I do have an extensive set of labels that I can fine tune a model on. While I can train `BERT` to do this, I want to be able to add labels in the future, so want to try finetuning an LLM. Is there a way to train this so that we limit the words that can be output after Answer? One way I can think of is looking at the logits of the word, but this depends on the tokenization (eg. apple could be ap\_, \_ple).

There is also the `instructor` library, but this doesn't work with transformer library models (eg. Llama-3) to my understanding, (at least not without hosting it separately).

AgentCloud internally uses Airbyte to build data pipelines allowing us to split, chunk, and embed data from over 300 data sources, including NoSQL databases like MongoDB. It simplifies the process of ingesting data into the vector store for the initial setup and subsequent scheduled updates, ensuring that the vector store information is always updated. AgentCloud uses Qdrant as the vector store to efficiently store and manage large sets of vector embeddings. For a given user query the RAG application fetches relevant documents from vector store by analyzing how similar their vector representation is compared to the query vector.

>You can find more info about how it works and how to use it in the project’s README and We're launching cloud version by end of this week. 

We’re also very open to contributions and added good first issues for beginners.

* Sync strategies - we still need to implement ability to change to incremental append instead of full overwrite
* Chunking strategies - We have semantic chunking, we want to implement custom strategies that would work well with Airbyte connections - currently chunking message by message (Rust)
* Retrieval strategies - Currently we use agents to craft the query, we would either like more standard retrieval strategies that can be added out of the box in our RAG connector (TS, Python, Mongo)
* Conversation app ease of setup - we have a design pattern we would like to employ to make setup of conversation apps simpler. 
* APIs - Publish our current Web App APIs as open API spec and more.

\- Since Chat GPT has been released, StackOverflow is declining in popularity (see chart below from Google trends) - so it makes sense for SO owners

DDR3 was significantly cheaper than DDR4 even though offering little to no performance drop, x99 boards were available with only DDR4 and didn't have any DDR3 boards. As for the GPU, I went with the mi50 16gb because it was available here for just around $130. So after some researching here is what I found:

Concerns:

* I'm planning to do Video Generative Model Training, and I'm still relatively unsure whether or not Ram matters a lot, it seems like having a lot of ram you could do less streaming data on disk, and offload it to Ram for faster access from GPU. If you don't I assume it would just hinder data reading speed?
* As for storing Data, I don't know if I would actually need to build out a Storage Cluster for this? It seems like it's also possible to tream data to the nodes though it would be very slow? Or potentially just do data slicing so that the amount of data isn't too large for any node? Can I potentially train let say with 10TB of data first, then because my disk is full, delete the current batch data and get another 1OTB of data to then continue training, is that possible?
* As for MI50 as well, it seems like rocm has dropped support for this card, I was planning to use Zluda, basically a drop-in driver on top of CUDA for AMD, which uses the Rocm 5.7, is this going to affect the stability of the GPU at all if I'm training on Pytorch with Zluda?

Option #1: Potentially Ram Restricted But less?

We are in the process of selecting, training and using an AI model to determine the best sequence of marketing actions for the next few weeks to maximize INCREMENTAL sales for each customer segment for a B2B consumable product (i.e. one that needs to be purchased on a periodic basis). Many of our customers are likely to buy our products even without promotions - however, we have seen that weekly sales increase significantly when we have promotions

Historically, we have executed campaigns that include emails, virtual meetings and in-person meetings.

We have the following data for each week for the past 2 years

1. Total Sales (this is the target variable) for each segment
2. Campaign type

Our hypothesis is that INCREMENTAL weekly sales depend on a variety of factors including the customer segment, the channel (in-person, phone call, email) as well as the SEQUENCE of actions.

Our initial assumption is that promotions during any 4 week period has an impact on INCREMENTAL sales over the next 4 weeks. So campaigns in February have a significant impact in March but not much in April or May.

In general we have only one type of connect in any specific week (so either in-person, or phone or email). Therefore, in any 4 week period we have 3x3x3x3 = 81 combinations. (There are some combinations that are extremely unlikely such as in-person meetings every week for 4 weeks - so that actual number of combinations is probably slightly less than 81).

We are considering a 2 step process

1. For each segment and for each of the 81 combinations predict sales for the next 4 weeks. Subtract Predicted Sales from the Actual Sales for current 4 week period to find INCREMENTAL sales for next 4 weeks
2. Select the combination with the highest INCREMENTAL sales

For step 1, two of my data scientists are proposing different options.

Bob proposes Option A: Use regression. As per Bob, there is very limited temporal relationship between sales in different time periods so a linear regression model should be sufficient. He wants to try out linear regression, random forest and XGBoost. He thinks this approach can be tested quite quickly (\~8 weeks) and should give decent results.

Susan proposes Option B: As per Susan, we should use a time series method since sales for any segment for a given 4 week period should have some temporal relationship with prior 4 week periods. She wants to try smoothing techniques, ARIMA as well as deep learning methods such as vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU. She is asking for about 12-14 weeks but says that this is a more robust method and is likely to show higher performance.

We have some time pressures to show some results and don't have resources to try both in parallel.

Any advice regarding how I should choose between the 2 options?",1,3

Spent the past few hours putting together some data on vLLM (for both Llama 7B and OPT-125M) and Resnet-50 training performance on the TensorDock cloud. 

vLLM data is 100% out of the box, with 2048 batch sizes from [this repository](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/tree/main/benchmarks). 

My learnings:

* H100 and A100 performance is unbeatable, but the price-to-performance of lower-end RTX cards is pretty darn good. Even the L40 and RTX 6000 Ada outperform the A100 at some tasks, as they are 1 generation newer than the A100. **If your application does not need 80GB of VRAM, it probably makes sense to not use an 80GB VRAM card**
* Standalone H100 performance isn't as strong as I would have imagined. H100 performance is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth for LLM inference, hence **H100s are only 1.8x faster than A100s for vLLM**. H100s really perform better when interconnected together, but I didn't benchmark that today. 
* **CPU matters more than I expected**. The OPT-125M vs Llama 7B performance comparison is pretty interesting... somehow all GPUs tend to perform similar on OPT-125M, and I assume that's because relatively more CPU time is used than GPU time, so the GPU performance difference matters less in the grand scheme of things.  
* The marketplace prices itself pretty well. If cohort GPUs into VRAM amount all GPUs with similar amounts of VRAM share a similar price-to-performance ratio.
* Self hosting can save you $$$ if you have sufficient batch sizes. If you built your own inference API, you could serve LLMs utilizing just 50% batches and save money compared to a pay-per-token API (we \[TensorDock\] cost less than $0.07 per million Llama 7 tokens if you use us at 100%)

\-- 

Let me know which GPU to benchmark next, and I'll add that! Or let me know some other workload to measure, and I'd be happy to add an new section for that too. 

P.S. We added some H100s at $1.80/hr for anyone lucky enough to grab them! ",5,36

**Abstract**:

>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning. However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability. To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission ***Grade School Math 1000*** (**GSM1k**). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark, the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more. When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 13%, with several families of models (e.g., Phi and Mistral) showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes. At the same time, many models, especially those on the frontier, (e.g., Gemini/GPT/Claude) show minimal signs of overfitting. Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's *r*^(2)=0.32) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that many models may have partially memorized GSM8k.",16,64
MachineLearning,t3_1ckiamf,1714880480.0,/r/MachineLearning/comments/1ckiamf/d_r_are_there_any_methodsworks_that_enable/,Discussion,[D] [R] Are there any methods/works that enable extracting high-quality dense feature map from CLIP/OpenCLIP image encoders without large scale finetuning?,"Hi, as stated in the title, I'm curious if such methods exist. We know that (trained) CLIP's image and text encoders both output an 1D vector that are aligned in the latent space, which allows to easily compute the similarities between a batch of images and texts. However, in many vision applications, it is desirable to get a 3D feature map of shape C\*H\*W. Ideally, if the vector at each spatial location in this feature map is as high-quality as the final (attention-pooled) encoded 1D image vector of CLIP, we can compute the similarity of the feature map and texts at each location, and get some sort of 2D attention/similarity/score map between image and text, which would be very helpful for many downstream tasks.

I'm aware that CLIP has been applied to many (open-vocabulary/zero-shot) detection/segmentation tasks, and some of the works explores similar ideas I stated above, but most them are pretty complicated and cannot be used in a plug-and-play fashion. The works that are the closest are [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03647) and [MaskCLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01071), but I found it hard to replicate their results.

I'm curious what you think about this. I know that the objective of contrastive pretraining doesn't really gaurentee good dense feature map but I'm wondering if there's anything that I'm missing.",12,11
