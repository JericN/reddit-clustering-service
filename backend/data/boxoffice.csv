This time around however, the very first bit of anything I saw for a new Mad Max movie was during the trailers for Dune 2, which I saw March 29th. Immediately I assumed it was a souless reboot, something I knew about Fury Road was that the OG director returned, and I did not know he was on board for this one too based on the trailer. In addition, Chris Hemsworth paired with a new lead in Anna Taylor Joy immediately brought to mind the shitty Men in Black reboot that was a soulless cash grab. I immediately told my girlfriend, who was a prior Mad Max fan and excited about it, ""that looks terrible"". What confuses me is how great the marketing was for Fury Road that even I, an outsider who never saw it, understood and felt the impact of the upcoming and eventual release of the film. They really fumbled the bag with this movie, I work at a theater and it did incredibly poorly despite great reviews. Just wanted to share my two cents.

Edit: Not one to complain about downvotes but god damn, this subreddit is one of the worst, its a bunch of nerds who don't know what they're talking about betting on box office results like they're horses at the race, while largely no one actually thinks like a real human (real humans are films primary demographic).

###**Garfield**

Garfield expectedly suffers more as an animation on the weekday.


**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.2  , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban: 7.0

A small sample size of 6k ratings but so far the movie appears to be received positively with very high 9.5-9.6 rating average on Taopiaopiao. Women make up a majority of the viewers with a 63-37% split.

Surprisingly enough the 30-40 age groups have the highest % of viewers likely fueled by parents of kids leaving reviews. People over 40 have rated the movie the best with a high 9.8 ratings average.

#**Furiosa**

Furiosa starts pre-sales incredibly late and its not exactly a hot start either. For comparison Garfield also started its pre-sales at T-3 last week and collected $55k in its first 24 hours.

So yeah probably best not to expect any crazy or even decent number from China for this one.

#**Dragon Boat Festival(June 10th)**

Dragon Boat Festival lands on a Monday this year so its a single day holiday linked to the weekend instead of a 3 day period. 

Its early June date this year which is a bit too soon for the summer season that starts at the end of the month means there's not really anything heavy hitting schedule for it but there will be a barage of small to mid sized local movies hitting alongside 2 Holywood movies in Civil War and Furiosa.

Furiosa finnaly starts pre-sales and yeah its not good.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 


**Dragon Boat Festival(June 10th):**

The Dragon Boat Festival lands on a Monday this year which means its gonna be a single day holiday linked to the weekend.

I decided to seek out some of the highest grossing r-rated animated films to gauge the genre's strength (or lack thereof). It should be pretty obvious, without crunching any numbers, to conclude that this genre often has a weak appeal at the box office - but a deeper skim through each movie's performance and their content/subject matter as well as the circumstances they released in, will serve a greater understanding of why a few have ""hit"" the way they did.

For more focus and obvious reasons, I will try to leave out some pornographic films and might also include films not given any adult rating yet still tackling adult themes. There won't be huge write-up for every film I mention here, but I try to inculcate significant talking points wherever I think it's necessary. I will try to go in chronological order to give a sense of how well that particular film did for it's time/adjusted for inflation. Alright here we go:

**Fritz the Cat (1972)**

It's pretty apt to start with the first animated film to receive an ""X"" rating in the US (i.e. no one under 17 allowed to view in theaters). It was directed by Ralph Bakshi (also more well-known for the 1978 animated Lord of the Rings movie) - who is considered as one of the pioneers in bringing adult animation with critical and audience acclaim into wider acceptance. His directorial debut here is a prime example of this.

Now it's evident that at the time this came out, animation was meant for children - it was not expected to be oriented to a more mature audience in any sense, push new boundaries or tackle any sort of political commentary. Another critical factor at that time was the dominance of Walt Disney in the genre - it had virtually 0 competition from any other singular/independent production company. Both points I raise here are exactly why Bakshi envisioned something new, something different for the medium. He wanted to see animation tackle dramatic stories on a bigger scale, and for the medium to aim for more than just a child's fairytale.

""Fritz the Cat"" was developed on a production budget of **$700,000** (a number that is disputed due to slightly different accounts by Bakshi himself - I will mention this below) - and initially faced issues in the early stages of development. The author of the comic strip this was based on (Robert Dennis Crumb) experienced friction with Bakshi's adaptation since Crumb, being a leftist, found the narrative to be critical of certain notions of the political left ideology. For context - the film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations and the free love movement, as well as serving as a criticism of the ""countercultural political revolution"" (the anti-establishment movement of the 60s and 70s) and dishonest political activists.

Again - it should be pretty evident that if you were attempting something like this especially in the kind of time and circumstances it were, calling you ""bold"" would be a gross understatement. For the very reasons I say here, when Bakshi and his producing partner Steve Krantz took the screenplay to see who'd pick it, nearly every major distributor rejected the film. I say ""nearly"", because in came Warner Bros. as a lifeline. Bakshi recounts the first time he screened a presentation reel of the film for the studio execs - ""When I first screened a bit of Fritz... I'll remember their faces until I die. One of (the execs)  left the room. Holy hell, you should have seen his face. 'Shut up, Frank! This is not the movie you're allowed to make!' And I said, Bullshit, I just made it.""

To return to the budget dispute -  In 1972, The Hollywood Reporter stated that Fritz the Cat recouped its costs in four months following its release. A year later the magazine reported that the film grossed $30 million worldwide and was produced on a budget of $1.3 million. In 1993, director Ralph Bakshi said ""Fritz the Cat, to me, was an enormous budget ‚Äì at $850,000 ‚Äì compared to my Terrytoon budgets."" In an interview published in 1980, Bakshi stated ""We made the film for $700,000. Complete"".

Nevertheless, the film was a monstrous hit for its time - not just for animation but in the sphere of independent filmmaking as a whole. It opened on April 12, 1972, in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. Although the film only had a limited release, it went on to become a worldwide hit. Against its $700,000 budget, it grossed $25 million in the United States and over $90 million worldwide, and was at that point the most successful independent animated feature of all time.\[19\] The film earned $4.7 million in theater rentals in North America.

To help you appreciate just how successful it was, you adjust that 90 mil number for inflation - that's approximately $675,103,349 in today's money. Bakshi claims he never got paid his cut of that money.

**Heavy Traffic (1973)**

Bakshi followed up Fritz the Cat with this film, the very next year, teaming up with his producing partner Steve Krantz again. The budget was $950,000. Now there's a whole complicated fiasco with Bakshi and Krantz going back and forth about Bakshi not being paid his cut from Fritz, but I'm not going to touch a lot on that here. Basically Krantz lied to him saying Fritz didn't make much money, and Bakshi who, though found the claims dubious, didn't have the know-how of much lawyer consultation.

Heavy Traffic received an X-Rating from the MPAA, and due to the very recent mega success of Fritz the Cat, theater owners were becoming increasingly receptive to more adult-oriented animation. And they were right to do so - While Heavy Traffic wasn't as big of a hit as Fritz , it was a decent enough coup for Bakshi with it's $1.3 million, who became the first person since Walt Disney to have 2 financially successful films back-to-back.

**The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat (1974)**

Of course there's a sequel - why wouldn't there be? But Ralph Bakshi wasn't returning in any capacity this time. The film was directed by Robert Taylor. In the vein of the first movie making history as the first to be an X-Rated animated film, the sequel was the first animated film to be Rated R. Here's a tidbit on why Ralph Bakshi didn't return (SPOILER ALERT) - The concept of a sequel to Fritz the Cat was a point of contention between Bakshi and Krantz, as Bakshi wanted to end his film with Fritz's death, and Krantz wanted Fritz to live at the end, to leave room for sequels.

Interestingly, the movie was entered into competition for 1974's Cannes Film Festival, and was even nominated for the Golden Palm.

The movie was not well-received, and to this day is accused of racism/sexism, despite achieving somewhat of a cult-following. It had a budget of $1.5 million, and earned $3 million at the box office.

**American Pop (1981)**

Another film directed by Ralph Bakshi. It was distributed by Colombia Pictures. This was a product of Bakshi wanting do something ""more personal"" after the production struggles of 1978's animated The Lord of The Rings.

I don't have extremely concrete numbers for this one - but AFI's website mentions a budget of $5 million and the-numbers.comes notes the film's box office as $6 million, all of it domestic (which comes out to be $23,266,183 in today's currency).

**Heavy Metal (1981)**

This is another success story for adult animation - directed by Gerald Potterton and distributed by Colombia Pictures, the film raked in $20.1 million on an estimated budget of $9.3 million. The critical reception was mixed. A remastered 4K version of the film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 19, 2022, bundled with a Blu-ray Disc release of the sequel, Heavy Metal 2000 (2000).

**The Plague Dogs (1982)**

This was a UK production - the first non-family-oriented MGM animated film, and the first adult animated feature by the studio. It was made on a production budget of ¬£900,000 (US$1.2 million). The film originally released in the US unrated but later for its DVD releases the MPAA gave it a ""PG-13"" rating. This was also disputed by people at the time since evidently the movie tackles an extremely downbeat subject of animal cruelty and, in the words of a New York Times review, ""it portrays it as though it was live-action.""

All this became a major reason why, despite there being some semblance of a market for adult-oriented animation, the subject-matter this particularly took on was not appealing to a wider audience and certainly not to younger ones. The film flopped with just ¬£308,000 (US$423,281) at the box office.

**Hey Good Lookin' (1982)**

Another entry from Ralph Bakshi and distributed by Warner Bros, this film was actually completed way back in 1972 as a live-action/animation hybrid but Warner apparently did not like that particular cut, and it was postponed indefinitely.

Ulimately, Bakshi made the current version of the film in which the film was predominantly animated and dialogues were heavily re-edited, and the film went largely unnoticed because it never really received a wide release. It ended up developing a cult following over the years. To this day, the original cut of the film has not been released, and Bakshi has allegedly disowned the released version. I don't have concrete numbers but it goes without saying that the film was NOT a success at the box office.

&#x200B;

**Pink Floyd ‚Äì The Wall (1982)**

I'm giving a cheeky little mention to this one - even though its not technically a fully animated film, rather a live-action/animation hybrid. This was distributed by MGM and written by Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. A synopsis - ""The Boomtown Rats vocalist Bob Geldof made his film debut as rock star Pink, who, driven to neurosis by the pressures of stardom and traumatic events in his life, constructs an emotional and mental wall to protect himself. However, this coping mechanism eventually backfires, and Pink demands to be set free.""

Given the band's rising popularity at the time, the film was a success, collecting $22.3 million against a budget of $9 million.

**Akira (1988)**

Initially released in Japan, Tohi on July 16, and released in the US the following year. The budget was $5.7 million. I don't even think I need to mention the sheer cultural phenomenon this film was and still is - from various VHS/DVD releases, the film ended up earning over $80 million worldwide (around $212 million when adjusted for inflation) in home video sales. It has been cited as a masterpiece and is widely regarded by audiences and critics as one of the greatest films ever made, especially in the field of animation and in the action and science fiction genres. It is regarded as a landmark in Japanese animation, and the most influential and iconic anime film ever made. It is also a pivotal film in the cyberpunk genre, particularly the Japanese cyberpunk subgenre, as well as adult animation. The film had a significant effect on popular culture worldwide, paving the way for the growth of anime and Japanese popular culture in the Western world as well as influencing numerous works in animation, comics, film, music, television, and video games.

**South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut (2000)**

Oh man this was a MAGICAL thing to experience in cinemas I kid you not. Just sitting down to watch this with your friends in a packed full theater also enjoying the shit out of it - man it tingles the nostalgic nerve.

Due to the obvious popularity that followed the original series, this was a hit at the box-office with $83.1 million against a production budget of $21 million. The original show creators (Trey Park & Matt Stone) were adamant that the film have an R-Rating and despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures executives to tone down the film, Parker and Stone's conditions were eventually met.

The film had decent WOM (the B- Cinemascore isn't excellent) and it had legs. It actually opened Number 4 at the box office, behind another little film called Wild Wild West, as well as Tarzan and Big Daddy.

&#x200B;

**Sausage Party (2016)**

Alright we're taking a *time jump* \- 16 full years at that, a lot of the films in between in this timeframe and even before were majorly flops for the mature-themed animation genre. I'd assume a fair few number of you might remember this one and even your discourse about it on the sub as it's fairly recent. This film has held the title of the highest grossing R-Rated Adult-Animation film (until it was recently overtaken by 2020's Demon Slayer with monstrous numbers). It's even got a streaming series greenlit, based on  film and titled ""Sausage Party: Foodtopia"", scheduled for release in July this year.

Against a budget of $19 million, it cashed in nearly $142 million. But what? Why? HOW?? TheWrap has a great article detailing 8 reasons for its huge success, but a TL;DR would go like this - early screenings (especially at SDCC) created good buzz and WOM; the trailer was \*extremely\* popular, viewed more than 200 million times; a release targeting college students right before their fall semester; and a well-worked marketing run from Seth Rogen and Co.

&#x200B;

**Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba ‚Äì The Movie: Mugen Train (2020)**

We've reached the final stop - this is the **crowning champion** of the genre, the most successful R-Rated animated film at the box office. This film premiered in Japan in October 2020 - amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic. It subsequently released in international markets until mid-2021. With a production budget of $15.7 million, the film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $507 million worldwide and making it the highest-grossing film of 2020. It marked the first time ever that a non-American production topped the annual global box office and set a number of box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time, a title previously held by Spirited Away (2001). It shouldn't really come as a surprise why this film resonated so much - Demon Slayer is a giant of a franchise and the hype for it in Japan was through the roof, as evidenced by the numbers.

***Final Thoughts --*** It's clear to me that the genre's somewhat bursting-onto-the-scene and it's later middling results coupled with some genuine hits suggest an obviously risky endeavour for a studio in today's age. So you can't be mad to see the only ones having any staying power especially in Western markets being things like Sausage Party - that's what captured the zeitgeist of the particular demographic it was being aimed at.

I think it's apt here, as I close, to give an honourable mention to **Guillermo Del Toro's Pinnochio** \- not exactly a theatrical film and not collecting much even for the time it released, nor is it technically ""adult"" - but it tries to tackle mature themes and I think it's imperative we shine a light on people like Del Toro who have long advocated for animation as more than just a kids' medium. **If we want animation to be taken ""seriously"", we need to start supporting those who try to be bold enough in creating challenging films in this medium.**

I hope from all this you were able to extract some food-for-thought - as I have. Thank you for reading!",15,21

https://preview.redd.it/und29d0cpb4d1.jpg?width=1149&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db65fccd361ea411bfd7db46cdeb1fd3c85ad5aa

*We then asked folks in the Casual and Home groups¬†why they don‚Äôt go to the theater more often. This was done through an open-ended question, meaning they weren‚Äôt given pre-determined choices. There was no prompting of answers.*¬†

*Many of the results were as expected. For example, 44% of people said that cost was a factor. Beyond price, the second most cited reason for not going to the theater was the convenience of watching at home. Neither one of those is especially surprising. But, further down the list was an answer that did catch us off guard.*¬†

*Four percent of people said that they don‚Äôt go to the theater because they know the film will be available to watch at home in a matter of weeks. That‚Äôs right, people are becoming increasingly savvy about the collapsing theatrical windows.*¬†

*Agreed, 4% is not a lot. For an industry that was pulling in over $11B in domestic grosses before the pandemic, a 4% reduction represents roughly $500M. That‚Äôs not an earth-shattering amount, though for an industry that is trying to return to pre-pandemic levels,*¬†***it‚Äôs an important figure***.

*Still, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to this number for two reasons. First, in all likelihood, the percentage of people who understand windows and skip the theater in favor of waiting to watch a film at home is likely higher than 4%. That‚Äôs just the number of people who were able to name that as a reason off the top of their head in an unprompted survey. There are countless others who feel the same way but cited other reasons or simply couldn‚Äôt recall windows in a survey environment.*¬†

*Second, this number is likely to grow. For those who love and support theatrical, it‚Äôs vitally important that we put a lid on this number. Four percent may seem ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù or ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù (though we would argue it‚Äôs already too high), but we have to ensure that it doesn‚Äôt creep higher in the months and years to come.*¬†

*The argument for shrinking windows is clear. The lion‚Äôs share of a film‚Äôs box office grosses are made in the first six weeks. After that, you enter the long tail. So why not pull it from theaters and move the film on to its next revenue stream¬†while the marketing is still relatively fresh in people‚Äôs minds?*

*For decades, audiences have known that a film would eventually be available to watch at home through video or TV. They also knew they had to wait several months for that to happen. That created a theatrical urgency. If you didn‚Äôt catch it in theaters, you had to be patient. Audiences understood that choice.*¬†

*Today, that wait has been reduced to only a few weeks. Case in point: THE FALL GUY, which became available as a digital release just three weeks after opening in theaters. The film grossed over $8M the week before it hit streaming, and it was still in the top 5.*¬†

*The good news is that FALL still made over $7.5M over the long Memorial Day weekend despite also being available to watch at home. That means there is still an appetite to see the film in theaters, which is great for Universal. They get two bites at the apple‚Äîrevenue from theaters and revenue from home viewership.*¬†

*The desire to double-dip is only going to hurt them in the end. That 4% of people who said they don‚Äôt go to theater because of shrinking windows will only grow larger if studios continue to support that behavior. There are lots of reasons why the summer box office is down. We can talk about the films themselves, the marketing, the challenge of launching new IP, etc. But let‚Äôs not ignore the fact that the studios have trained people not to go to the theater.*¬†

*As we talk about the doom of gloom of the summer box office, it‚Äôs not hard to see why grosses are down.¬†And quite frankly, it‚Äôs up to the studios to overcome a problem they helped to create.*¬†",43,32

However most of all what really convinced me to finally let go of any excuses is GxK 2, a direct vs film sequel on paper according to many should've failed on every metric but managed to defy all expectations. Why? Its hard to say though despite objectively being a drop in quality from Godzilla v Kong thankfully didn't matter as Legendary for once decided having a director return to properly craft an authentic follow up to a previous installment expanding further on what people liked

Factoring all of this in you start realizing Wingard understandably gone ahead to retcon KotM out continuity because no shared universe can afford wasting their future on revising a lackluster sequel in blockbuster cinema

I believe the movie going experience is in a special position due to streaming and content. The MPAA, in their theatrical market reports, would regularly compare the movie going experience to sports and theme parks as a recreational thing to do.

Full Disclosure: This is not a serious analysis and I don't have too strong an opinion about specifics. I'm taking the data at face value even though we all know about the possibilities of inaccuracies. I think the sources are okay even if they're not from official organizations that oversee the category of event. There's obviously lots of data and stats to throw around and include, but that'd take up a lot of time to account for everything pertinent.

To start things off, the theater going rate is definitely down after 2020.

&#x200B;

After all this, what does it mean? I don't have an in depth answer, but here are my thoughts. People clearly still like going out and doing stuff. When money is still  thrown around for sports and concerts,  inflation or ""people would rather stay in"" as answers for why movies are down don't work for me. It's other common reasons that people say like a short theater to home video timeline, a problem with guests, and a lack of some quality choices compared to the competition on streaming. 

Obviously, there are major differences between spectating a sport, visiting a theme park, and going to the cinema, but it's worth looking at how consumers are spending their money in these hobby areas, especially the more art centered ones. Tickets sold/attendance totals were seeing an increase for practically everything from 2000-2019 except movies which had its peak in 2002. ",9,12

- will not be streaming just weeks after release

- offers a unique experience (a film entirely in sign language, with open captions)

- is putting butts in seats at a time when so much is not selling well and this sub is full of laments over the current state of the box office

- is generating FOMO in the nation's deaf community. Have spoken with people who have anxiously exclaimed they need to get their tickets soon. 

- is getting a lot of free promotion in its target community. Our Facebook feed is currently full of posts from people and deaf organizations announcing new screening locations and/or saying they plan to go to this film.

- don't know what is going on in churches, but there are deaf churches, churches with deaf congregations, and churches with interpreted services. Guessing that the churches are encouraging their congregations to go. So, organizational support is a factor.

- is attracting people to theaters who have avoided theaters for years, like the friend mentioned in a previous post about this film.

Based on the above observations, does this film hold any clues to what might help to save theaters? Do theaters need to start focusing on films that offer more unique experiences and are not likely to head to streaming? 

Struggling theater owners ought to take a look at the data and  maybe consider contacting the organization that is putting this film in theaters, to voluntarily request a screening. We are only halfway done collecting current data, and already, the numbers are amazing.  We're seeing theaters that have offered open captions for some time, sell the most seats we have ever seen sold. For example, a Regal in Tennessee has sold 96 seats already for one screening. So far, have documented 203 trackable theaters (this number will grow as more theaters are added). Of those 203, so many seats have already sold relative to the total number of screen times that it has already surged past the 5.00 threshold used to determine box office hits, to already past 7.00. Don't know if the final ratio will hit Barbenheimer level, but it just might!

Edit: it just went past 8.00.

Young Woman and the Sea was greenlight by Disney a couple of years ago for direct-to-streaming on Disney+. They didn't expect it to be so good. They lucked out on this hidden gem but they still treated it like a potato. Only giving it a half-ass limited theatrical release with minimal marketing, because it turned out to be the highest tested movie of legendary producer Jerry Bruckheimer's career. He is a big deal, plus he kept nagging them for a theatrical run.

So it's not in a ton of theaters nationwide, and they say it's coming to Disney+ in a couple of weeks, but I can't recommend it enough. It's a shame it's flying under the radar.",197,543

#**Weekend Box Office (May 31st-June 2nd)**

With May now behind us a quick update on the yearly box office. 2024 is pacing very close to last year going into the summer season being only -2% down. Which means its still down about -20% to the pre-covid and record breaking 2019.

https://i.imgur.com/F69s3iV.png

Holywood's 2024 take so far stands at ¬•2.03B which is down -6% compared to where it was at the same point last year.

https://i.imgur.com/SdG3mil.png

Last year started out slow but then got a massive boost in May with Fast X and GOTG3. This year in turn had Dune 2, GxK and KFP4 in March and Aprill carry the weight. June however is looking bleak for Holywood this year. Last year had Fast X still doing bussiness. Across The Spider-Verse doing almost $50M. Transformers doing $90M+. Flash doing $20M+

Meanwhile this year Civil War, Furiosa, Bad Boys 4 and IF are not expected to do big numbers. At least none of them is expedted to pass 20M. Inside Out 2 is likely the only movie with a realistic chance to try for $20M+


As for the weekend. Of the back of Childrens Day 2 animation releases dominate the charts. The new Doraemon movie which is by now a stable Childrens Day release wins the weekend ahead of Garfield. 

The Last Frenzy and Twilight of the Warriors both hold respectably while behind a whole bunch of next weeks releases hold pre-screenings.

###**Garfield**

Garfield opens with a really good $8.2M and seems to have good reception. The big Childrens Day will limit its multiplier but it should try for $13-14M. Next week is quite busy with the Dragon Boat Festival however there's no animation releasing for it so Garfield might have a relatively free market in that regard if it can keep some semblance of screenings.


**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan:  , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban: 

A small sample size of 6k ratings but so far the movie appears to be received positively with very high 9.5-9.6 rating average on Taopiaopiao. Women make up a majority of the viewers with a 63-37% split.

Surprisingly enough the 30-40 age groups have the highest % of viewers likely fueled by parents of kids leaving reviews. People over 40 have rated the movie the best with a high 9.8 ratings average.

#**Dragon Boat Festival(June 10th)**

Dragon Boat Festival lands on a Monday this year so its a single day holiday linked to the weekend instead of a 3 day period. 

Its early June date this year which is a bit too soon for the summer season that starts at the end of the month means there's not really anything heavy hitting schedule for it but there will be a barage of small to mid sized local movies hitting alongside 2 Holywood movies in Civil War and Furiosa.

And yes Civil War has somehow lost screenings since yesterday.

On Furiosa. It has still not started pre-sales with less than a week till release which is why its not in the chart.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering.

boxoffice,t3_1d6guoq,1717344959.0,/r/boxoffice/comments/1d6guoq/weekend_update/,:southkorea: South Korea,Weekend update,"Furiosa: With an excellent 31% drop from last weekend as the movie is benefiting from The Plot being hated by the public. 

The RoundUp Punishment: A 45% drop from last weekend as the movie continues to chug along to a very nice total. 

Haikyuu: A 52% drop from last weekend as the movie is looking to push 600k admits. Haikyuu is the biggest anime of the year in terms of money and admits in South Korea.

Garfield: An adequate 44% drop as the movie will clear 300k admits next weekend.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: A pretty bad 76% collapse from last weekend. 900k admits will be the last milestone.

Last notes

1. IF will end it run at roughly 700k dollars. 

2. Dune 2 is completely over clocking in 16.9 million dollars and was 132 admits away from hitting 2 million admits.

3. Challengers should end its run just around 600k dollars. An pretty impressive run when you look at the movie and the market. 

4. KP4 fails to reach 12 million dollars and is such a disappointment for the franchise here

What does this suggest about their strategy?,"Title says it all. Inside Out 2's social embargo lifts a mere 4 days before it hits theatres, while reviews aren't allowed until the 12th, a shockingly close 2 days.

For comparison, Wish's social embargo lifted almost three weeks prior to the film's release, while the review embargo was just over a week prior. Pixar-wise, Elemental (not counting its Cannes screening) had its embargoes lifted May 28th, a vast stretch before its June 16th debut. Even Lightyear let its reviews go live 6 days in advance.

What do we think has caused this change in strategy? Is the film not as good as audiences would hope and it's a form of damage control? Or simply attempting to avoid a repeat of how reviews may have affected their recent movies' box office? How might the reception impact the OW; as it's a sequel to a known IP, is it effectively immune to negative press anyway?",27,26

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

- YM! (Marcus is doing $7 matinees for children and seniors all day every day before 4 PM for the summer **(May 31)**.)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $4.28M/$5.20M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $3.70M THU. Biggest outlier here is Equalizer ($6.47M), but that is also probably the best comp... tough to say with a release like this where we don't know just how backloaded it will be **(May 30)**. All these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18 so that'll go down. Feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find good comps (May 19).)

- el sid (Counted yesterday for THU had 395 sold tickets with shows in 6 theaters. 10 days left. Bad Boys for Life (6.36M from previews) had on MON of the release week 915 sold tickets = 43% at the moment for Bad Boys 4 with 7 days left to come closer or maybe overtake. My guess is that BB4 could have 800-1000k tickets by next MON, so it could be pretty much on par with BBfL. BB4 does not have stellar presales and after several disappointments I shouldn't exaggerate but compared to the best comps it looks quite good for BB4 as you can see (May 28).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $5.2M EA+THU.)

- keysersoze123 (We have to wait until early next week to tell the tale. These movies finish very strong. That said at this point I dont see a path for it to hit last movies OW ($62.5M). That is going to be a stretch plus the internal multi will be weaker relative to MLK weekend release of last movie. So I hope it goes for at least 6m previews to keep 50m OW in play **(June 1)**. Pace is definitely going up but is it enough. We will only with final week pace **(May 31)**. Still at very low pace **(May 30)**. Presales are again not that much at this point. I think its not going to hit the heights of last movie (May 28). It should start to amp up sometime this week (May 27). This wont be fan driven. Even the last one initially trailed Dr Do little in presales but amped up big time close to release. | This will be a late bloomer. I am still expecting 50m+ OW (May 23).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $5.55M THU. Pace staying steady, but it increased against all comps which is a good sign. 39% of total sales is coming from the greater Miami region, which is a really strong split. The demo for this film is perhaps coming out **(June 1)**. Actually slowed down a bit **(May 31)**. Not as good as yesterday's update, but still increasing against comps **(May 30)**. Excellent jump today. Starting to see the acceleration **(May 29)**. Steady pace, no acceleration yet. Switch to G x K since that had super strong walkups ($6.12M THU comp) and Bad Boys 4 will likely replicate this (May 27). Comps ($4.11M) would mean $40M+ Opening Weekend (May 24).)

- TwoMisfits (Aging male-skewing franchises tend to get the biggest bump from this deal. Folks are on the fence but know what they are getting. Female skewing non-sequel ones tend to get zero help.  You need baseline interest to get people willing to pay anything, b/c these still are $5.  The other effect of the deal is that movies releasing around the $5 hits sometimes get hurt. | June TMobile $5 Atom movie. This could help it go huge, like last year's Spider-Verse (May 22).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.6M THU. Even without the slap, I don't think the 15-25 demographic has much affinity for Will Smith. That younger demo though is usually key to getting a big walk up. Breakdown of sales on my numbers tilt heavily to the ages 19+ VIP screens. That strikes me as older audiences looking for an outing without teenagers. That audience is important, but there's a limit to how much business they can drive. I can definitely be wrong. But every day that we don't see trends reverse is making me nervous. | Slower than expected. It's staying pace with the films with a slow finish and falling behind the walk up heavy films **(June 1)**. A good and steady day **(May 31)**. A bounceback day that helped undo some of the damage from earlier this week **(May 29)**. It's not having a great week. It's slowly slipping against comps, when the hope was that it would be gaining. New showtimes went up for the THU, and it's only gotten one additional screen. It's the 4DX screen, which makes sense, as what else justifies a 4DX screen at this stage **(May 29)**. It's staying pretty flat (May 28). Zero sales day when all comps seemed to have done well. Not a great result. Note: This isn't a holiday weekend in Canada, so that doesn't explain the slow sales. Hopefully it's just an anomaly. This has been very steady to date (May 27). Ghostbusters and Apes both went up in comps, but I didn't have Hunger Games included, so it's brought the average down. Still, its growing at a steady pace (May 26). I still expect this to be more walk up friendly than the comps being used, and should see a gradual rise as the date gets closer (May 25). Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20).)

- YM! (Definitely overindexing in the more diverse areas of SE Wisconsin but underindexing in less diverse areas (like a reverse Furiosa). 57% ahead of Furiosa without EA puts us at 5.5M previews and whilst not the perfect comparison, I feel good about a surprise for this one so pencil me in at 4.5-5.5M previews. | Looking to overperform in SE Wisconsin if my four theaters are anything to go by. About 57% ahead of Furiosa and 170% ahead of Furiosa with Early Access. Definitely showing strongest signs in the Hispanic and Black heavy areas of SE Wisconsin **(June 1)**. Like IO2 the pace for Bad Boys is small but mighty. EA is only available at Majestic much like Garfield. With EA, it‚Äôs a few tickets shy of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 but without them it‚Äôs only a bit over half. Either way both is really good. I think we‚Äôll continue to see the gap grow over the week but as of rn, I am thinking around $6-7m previews without EA solely on vibes to an OW north of $55m (May 25). Same thing as IO2 for Bad Boys (see May 23 IO2 comment), I expect this to not only skew more GA friendly and should bulk up ticket sales as we get closer to release. It‚Äôs almost at half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 which is a pretty great thing. Should easily outdo it by T-6 imho (May 23).)

**The Watchers Average Thursday Comp: $0.86M**

- el sid (Had a pretty muted start in my theaters. Yesterday 37 tickets were sold for THU, May 6, and today it were 44 (with showtimes in 5 theaters). Comps (always counted for THU):Tarot (715k from previews) had with 6 days left 28 sold tickets. The First Omen (725k) had with 8 days left also 28 sold tickets. Abigail (1M) had with 6 days left 97 sold tickets. And The Strangers: Chapter One (1.2M) had on MON of the release week 215 sold tickets.  I don't think that The Watchers can reach the presales number of The Strangers, maybe half of that (= ca. 100 sold tickets next MON). So at the moment I go with around 500k from previews for The Watchers **(May 30)**.)

- filmlover (Hasn't sold anything near me (May 26).)

- Flip (These are good numbers considering it‚Äôs only playing in 2/3 theaters I track (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.86M THU Comp.)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Fellowship of the Ring (269 tickets, 6 showtimes, 4 theaters) on SAT, June 8, 2024 and SAT, June 15, 2024 (21 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). The Two Towers (243 tickets, 4 theaters) SAT, June 9, 2024 and SAT, June 16, 2024 (22 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). Return of the King (281 tickets, 4 theaters) for SAT, June 10, 2024 and SAT, June 17, 2024 (16 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). 852 tickets sold in total. 793 tickets sold for the first week. 59 tickets sold for the second week (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp *using TheFlatLannister's Florida comp*: $9.15M**

- NRG (Now tracking for $85M domestic debut **(May 30)**.)

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $5.84M THU. Keeps chugging along, comps will start converging soon **(May 30)**. Good update, hopefully this keeps on rising (May 23). Not impressed at all so far here sadly (May 19).)

- AniNate (Finally a little movement here. 23 THU, 52 Fri-Sun (compared to 18 THU and 23 FRI-SUN on May 17) (May 22). Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Some growth for THU, not bad but I expect sales to increase steadily as we get closer to release. Presales are good enough to not be a disaster like Garfield, but not big enough to guarantee a 100m opening. I still like what I‚Äôm seeing though. My local theater has finally shown some signs of life with this film. 5 tickets sold. Way better than Garfield at the same point. | Might not be completely accurate, but looking extremely strong on FRI. 900 tickets for the 5 theaters I track. Maybe even 1,286 tickets if my numbers are accurate. That tells me this is not front loaded whatsoever. Or at the very least not preview heavy (May 27). Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the THU previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on THU for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder (Comp: $12.2M THU at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27). Fan event on the 16th has 43 tickets sold from 2 showtimes (compared to 8 showtimes and 73 tickets sold for previews), so that might be depressing previews a bit.)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $6.2M THU. No great comps for this. The last week and especially final few days will tell everything we need to know **(May 31)**. Early sales haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18).)

- keysersoze123 (If you compare this to any animation movies seen recently including Minions, its doing very well.  | Really good this far out for sure (May 25). Chugging along at this point (May 19). Show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $8.94M THU.   I literally have zero good comps.  I generally don't keep track of sub-5m pure kids animated films until right before release. It is too backloaded (or rather NOT frontloaded) for the AtSVs of the world to make much sense. IO2 had a (too) long (by half) pre-sale window which is wrecking a whole bunch of other slightly more plausible comps. If I had a complete track of KFP4, that'd probably help a great deal. As often the case with films that should be very backloaded, won't really know how backloaded they are until the week of release. (will note that IO2 does seem to be picking up a hint of steam right now.  Which should bode well for its overall ticket total). | Horror is, along side pure kids animation, THE most backloaded genre there is when it comes to pre-sales.  ATP for the Nope comp will be wrecked, but the pace should be very instructive. Name recognition for Jordan Peele led to slightly stronger pre-sales for a non-franchise horror installment which should map fairly well with the in-built name recognition of IO2. Is complicated by the fact that Nope had an even longer pre-sale window than IO2, but that might help counterbalance some of the ATP errors. Won't be a good comp at the end but right now it might be one of the better ones, especially to show the insane growth that should be on the table.  I don't think it's much of a coincidence that it's one of the few comps I have right now that is pointing to double digit previews **(May 30)**. I don't agree with the undertone of concern when it comes to ticket sales.  They seem perfectly fine to me, maybe even somewhat strong.  It just isn't selling like a frontloaded CBM/fan driven franchise (even when adjusting for animation). So I suppose it really comes down to how much we think this will still act like a traditional kids animation film when it comes to buying pattern, how much demand has been burnt off, and how many people are still going to buy tickets but see no particular need to buy them early. Which I suppose really can't be answered until we get close to the time when kids animation films typically accelerate.  But, I keep looking at the sales in Sacramento and not seeing much cause for concern (May 25). Decided to add Nope ($12.62M) to the comp block.  Not because I think it's a particularly good one (ATP differences are a major red flag), but more for pace considerations considering how similar horror and kids animation are when it comes to being backloaded.  The other consideration with Nope is that it was on sale for nearly two weeks longer, so it did have a small amount of extra time to pad some seats sold.  But maybe the errors (ATP vs length of pre-sale) will cancel each other out.  PROBABLY NOT!  But the pace at the very least should be interesting (May 25).)

- Skim Beeble (I don't know if it's just me, but starting June 20th PLF showings for Inside Out 2 are stopping after around 4 PM. Is there possibly a surprise release coming or is it just a scheduling showtime thing from the chains. (This is AMC) **(May 29)**.)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $8.52M THU Florida and $7.57M THU Orlando Comp.  Thinking $85M OW is about right. Don't see much data as of right now to suggest a number much lower or higher than that **(May 31)**. Excellent pace this far out. Does feel like something big is around the corner (May 27).)

- vafrow (Comp: $13.2M THU. I still have a wide divide between comps. KFP4 just did tremendously well around here, making it a challenging comp to use. Or Garfield and IF being the opposite **(June 1)**. Take the comps with a grain of salt. The low numbers on IF and Garfield really throw things off. Numbers were flat all week before a jump in the last day **(May 29)**. It's starting to grow (May 25). I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19).)

- YM! (SouthEast Wisconsin: Already outdone Garfield minus EA. Ideally I‚Äôd like heavy buying to be prevalent next week with some form of buildup this week. Right now, looking at other data on here, put me down for 7-8M previews. At NS using pre-pandemic comparisons, it‚Äôs about 22% ahead of Onward‚Äôs T-9, 57% ahead of Sonic‚Äôs T-9 and 46% of Aladdin‚Äôs T-9 **(June 1)**. Using Keysersoze123's earlier MTC1 data, the pace is pretty good. $6.74M average THU comp. The same caveats apply (higher ATP than the other animations due to older skew and PLFs but having lower ATP than TLM as that skews older and likely has more of audience to buy upfront, and Wish being on Discount TUES muddies things up) but the important thing is that pace healthy and gainer ground against its comparisons. Feel like tracking is right on the money of 75-85m OW but could grow stronger if pace continues strong and reviews are strong (May 26). The pace is moving nicely as we have about two and a half weeks left. Think there‚Äôs potential for ticket count pace to grow strongly. I have no comparisons but it is at Garfield‚Äôs EA-less T-3 ticket sales. Going to probably not say much on preview predictions but my thoughts of an OW in between 75m-100m still stand. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out (May 25). Little has changed as IO2 keeps on trucking along. I do theorize at least from the 250 ticket selling Funko Event, it‚Äôs plausible families and fans went for that date instead of THU night previews. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out. At the very least, I like that it doubled its previous sales a week ago as it shows pace and outdid Garfield‚Äôs T-6 (May 23). Did some snooping around for the Funko Event as I was curious if perhaps families getting presales for the opening SAT vs opening THU as those sales are kind of weak THU and uhm it‚Äôs at 250 tickets. Which is like 5 times Garfield‚Äôs EA showing of 50 tickets all at PLF prices despite normal theaters. Most of which at 9:30 AM with only one theater having it at 11:00 AM (May 22). Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M THU comp and $22.2M FRI comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True FRI although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the THU average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount TUES so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20).)

**The Bikeriders**

- Pinacolada (Actually sold some around me. It does seem like Focus is giving it kind of a shitty release though. Small screens. Definitely no PLFs, which 20th Century Studios was gonna get it Dolby back when they had it. There's 3 theaters really near me. Only 1 of them has this on sale as of now, though the other 2 theaters may come later? (May 26).)

**A Quiet Place: Day One Average Thursday Comp: $4.09M**

- AnthonyJPHer (Alright start to presales, although kind of muted in my opinion. I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll start picking up the pace soon, but it‚Äôs alright. Not much to say here **(May 31)**.)

- Flip (Has a fan event on the same day of previews, PLF only **(May 30)**.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($4.84M THU comp.)

- Porthos (Took a look locally. Not too bad. Before I tracked DBOX, AQP2 sold 160 tickets at T-22 and....  AQPD1 sold 166 tickets at T-28. Now I am now tracking DBOX seats, which at a glance sold 19 tickets tonight.  However three theaters locally converted to having DBOX showings, so some local theaters will just have more DBOX sales. Still, basically in line with D1 of AQP2, more or less. Tickets sold for the 3pm fan event are practically non-existent right now (8 tickets sold).  There are so many problems with an AQP2 comp as to make it nearly worthless but... promising start, I'd say **(May 31)**.)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.44M THU Comp. Pretty good start, but nothing crazy or outright telling me a big breakout is coming **(May 31)**)

- vafrow ($3.0M THU comp. Second day didn't go as well **(June 1)**. Not a bad start. I don't have great comps with it starting at a month out **(May 31)**.)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp *using TheFlatLannister's Dune2+GOTG3 comp*: $29.31M**

- AMC (""Some 200,000 movie fans have bought their AMC tickets already. This is more Day 1 ticket sales at AMC than for any other R-rated movie ever."" Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that first-day sales are likely around $8 million to $9 million if extrapolating the 200,000 stat cited by Aron (May 22).)

- DEADLINE (Already heating up eight weeks before its debut, having already collected some $8M in first day ticket sales. $8M is pretty remarkable for an R-rated movie two months before release. While there are no direct comps on Deadpool & Wolverine ticket sales in post-Covid history, its current cash bests the 24-hour advance ticket sales of The Batman ($6.5M), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($6M) and John Wick: Chapter 4 ($1.4M). The Batman and GOTG3 opened to respective 3-day weekends of $134M and $118.4M (May 22).)

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. Best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M THU. Pretty damn great day 2! (May 21).)

- AniNate (THU sales still largely biased towards primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not enough for people to take off work early. | Good lord already 80+ THU previews sold for Deadpool at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Extremely strong growth from OD for THU. We have a monster on our hands here people. Buuut. Let me temper the excitement somewhat. The FRI numbers are good, stronger than Inside Out 2 by a considerable margin. However Inside Out 2 is looking very backloaded. This is looking extremely presales heavy right now. | Much more than IO2‚Äôs 1,200 tickets for FRI. But here lies the problem. There is only 122 tickets separating THU and FRI for Deadpool and Wolverine, and for IO2, there is 500 tickets between the two days for that movie. This far out I‚Äôm not freaking out. I think the gap will increase. It just alarmed me a little. I still think it‚Äôs going to be massive though. Just a word of caution (May 28). Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! Already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $28.23M THU. Weirdly strong day today, selling 200+ tix **(May 31)**. Moving along well (May 27). Nearly 300 sales day vs ~260 by Black Panther & ~200 of GOTG3. Another brilliant day. Given the length of sales window, comps be falling off but they have remained steady for first 4 days (May 24). Looking at keysersoze123's MTC1 data: These are incredible (May 22). $40.22M THU (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $25.69M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $31.04M/$38.62M/$40.21M/$22.35M (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver THU: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- jeffthehat (Took my first look in Indiana yesterday. Won't do a full post because I missed like 20 shows. But the gist is it was at ~3600 tickets sold and ~400 shows. Just as a point of reference, here are the highest values for tickets sold I have in my database. Bob Marley Wed T-1 = 3309 tickets sold. Dune 2 Thu T-1 = 3041 tickets sold. Godzilla x Kong Thu T-1 = 2328 tickets sold. Thus, sales are already the highest I've tracked with two months to go **(May 29)**.)

- keysersoze123 (Previews was taken late yesterday and FRI data was just now. Still going quite strong. very impressive after huge OD (May 28). Still really strong 3 days later (May 25). 1st few days of PS is all about fanboys so T-x does not matter. By this FRI it will be in steady state mode. With this long a cycle that would be at very low levels. | Looking at FRI sales, its IM will be closer to Thor 4 than BP2. So we can do the projections based on how the previews will go. However Its really early. Let us wait until we have T-x comps. Probably will have to wait until July to get credible comps. | MTC2 early sales tend to be way weaker for all movies. The disparity for big movies is even higher.  | Nothing out of ordinary in day 2 pace for MTC1 (May 22). Obvious skew on previews (compared to FRI) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19).)

- Legion Again (Previews this early in summer are almost a THU opening, so Fri soemthing like +35-55% from Th is IM ~4.9-5.5. If we get some strong Fri sales when we‚Äôre close maybe I‚Äôll drag it up to 5.6 or something but it will be really really tough to beat that. Expecting an IM close to Thor 4. Better reception (in avg case, just by regression to the mean) but bigger previews/more fanrush element, ~cancelling. | [T-65 Projection Matrix ($166M-$186M OW)](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/31569-the-box-office-buzz-tracking-and-pre-sale-thread/?do=findComment&comment=4680041) (May 22).)

- Porthos (Comp: $20.87M THU. Approx Earned So Far (Sacto Market Based Comps): $7.24M **(June 1)**. For long releases of MCU/SW Saga caliber, it usually takes about 6 to 8 days for the initial wave to stop. The Rise of Skywalker didn't really ""bottom out"" until D9 or so (T-51).  Then at T-21, more or less, it started up its acceleration again. Can see similar patterns for MCU long runners (May 24). MCU/SW films tend to have a bit longer of a slope-down on the decent of the ""u-curve"" so I think I'll keep posting ""Day x"" comps for at least a couple more days (May 23). Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M THU Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS MON opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($150M locked imo.  Don‚Äôt really see under $30M for previews and a 6x multi gets it to $180M OW. With GOTG 3 early reception I think $200M becomes a real discussion (May 22). $44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. Sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M THU GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THU COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane. Has almost 200 more showings than Inside Out 2.  Sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). Also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and it's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- Tinalera (Toronto having an especially good run on pre sales- overall sales looking healthy (May 27). For a movie this far out, yea presales are doing well in Vancouver and Calgary. Its hard as very few movies open this early, but its healthy when we are getting between 5-10 percent sales for a movie not due out for 2 months (May 24).)

- vafrow (Comp: $37.8M THU. Growth not quite as high as I'd like for a full week, but I'm pretty sure I had a miscount for one of the big IMAX screens that probably has thrown off the numbers. I've kept comps in, but I'm really stretching the utility **(June 1)**. 12% over two days is pretty strong once the rush passes. We're not at the bottom of the curve yet it seems (May 24). 8% growth at this stage is very positive. I expect another drop tomorrow, but I'm probably not going to touch this until the weekend at this stage. I'm comping high, and without a proper MCU comparison (Marvels doesn't count), it's hard to gauge, but I feel this is just doing really well here (May 22). 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards PLFs in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start. Definitely feels like we got a potential 25m previews/150m+ opener. Still don't buy 200m OW but am starting to see 30m previews/175m+ OW as a strong possibility. | On its first day has sold over 10x Furiosa T-6 here in SE Wisconsin. At North Shore, 70% of Shang-Chi‚Äôs and Venom 2‚Äôs T-2, 47% of Homecoming‚Äôs T-2, and 41.25% of Thor: Ragnar√∂k‚Äôs T-2 - just using DP&W‚Äôs T-66! | At half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-4 sales here in the past ten minutes in just two of the theaters PLF shows (May 20).)

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Richard Donner's turn.

Initially, Donner wanted to develop a career as an actor. He gained a bit part in a television program directed by Martin Ritt, who encouraged Donner to become a director instead, and he hired Donner as his assistant. Through his connections in Desilu, he started directing commercials. In the 60s, he transitioned into television, directing episodes for shows like *The Twilight Zone*, *The Fugitive*, *The Man from U.N.C.L.E.*, *Get Smart*, and *Gilligan's Island*. Afterwards, he had his chance to direct films. 

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1960s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**X-15 (1961)**

*""Actually filmed in space!""*

His directorial debut. It stars David McLean, Charles Bronson, James Gregory and Mary Tyler Moore, and presents a fictionalized account of the X-15 research rocket aircraft program, the test pilots who flew the aircraft, and the associated NASA community that supported the program.

There are no box office numbers available, but it is said that it had a short and poor theatrical run. Reviews were mixed, and Moore said she's not proud of the film.

#**Salt and Pepper (1965)**

*""Join the club.""*

His second film. It stars Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Michael Bates, Ilona Rodgers and John Le Mesurier, and follows two nightclub owners finding themselves in trouble over a woman's death. 

It received mixed reviews, and it earned $1.75 million in rentals.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,750,000 in rentals. ($17.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,750,000.

#**Lola (1970)**

*""It may be love... but it's definitely exhausting!""*

His third film. It stars Charles Bronson and Susan George, and follows a 38-year-old writer of pornographic novels who meets and falls in love with a sixteen-year-old school girl whilst living in London.

There are no box office figures, but you can be sure of something: it was panned by everyone.

#**The Omen (1976)**

*""If something frightening happens to you today, think about it.""*

His fourth film. It stars Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Harvey Spencer Stephens, Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern. The film's plot follows Damien Thorn, a young child replaced at birth by his father, unbeknownst to his wife, after their biological child dies shortly after birth. As a series of mysterious events and violent deaths occur around the family and Damien enters childhood, they come to learn he is in fact the prophesied Antichrist.

Producer Harvey Bernhard came up with the idea for a film about the Antichrist after talking with one of his friends. WB was on board, but they later pulled out, so 20th Century Fox agreed to distribute the film. Donner favored an ambiguous reading of the script under which it would be left for the audience to decide whether Damien was the Antichrist or whether the series of violent deaths in the film were all just a string of unfortunate accidents. Seltzer rejected the ambiguity favored by Donner and pressed for an interpretation of his script that left no doubt for the audience that Damien Thorn was the Antichrist and that all of the deaths in the film were caused by the malevolent power of Satan, the interpretation that Bernhard chose to go with.

There were some... dark stories over the making of the film. Some aren't confirmed, but others are verified. So take the following with huge grains of salt.

In September 1975, Peck was flying to London, and during the flight, lightning struck the plane. Shortly after, executive producer Mace Neufeld's plane was also struck by lightning while en route to Los Angeles. That's twice in a span of only a few weeks. Then, writer David Seltzer's plane was also struck by lightning. And, while filming in Rome, lightning narrowly missed striking Bernhard. Lightning may never strike twice, but four times, and to different people whose only six degrees of separation at the time was *The Omen*? Oh, it gets even creepier. A scene was postponed, which meant Peck was not needed on the set, so a private jet that the crew was going to charter to bring Peck in was not necessary. The next day, it was reported that the plane they had intended to book hit a flock of birds and crashed, killing everyone on board.

Neufeld, probably already on edge after his plane was struck by lightning, was planning to eat at a restaurant nearby, but it was hit by an IRA bombing. The day after filming, the hotel that Donner had stayed at was also bombed. 

John Richardson, the set designer, created a particularly macabre scene where a character dies from decapitation resulting from an automobile accident. While in Holland in August 1976, Richardson and his assistant, Liz Moore, were struck by a freakishly unfortunate fate. They fell victims to a head-on-collision, where Moore was cut in half, in similar fashion to the one Richardson had designed for the film. It happened in a Friday the 13th, near a road sign which says: ‚ÄúOmmen, 66.6 km.‚Äù

Does that send you shivers down your spine? 

Is all of this true? I... I'm not sure. I don't fully believe it. But I also don't fully *not* believe it. Whatever the case, it's truly one of the most insane behind-the-scenes stuff. 

After a slate of weak films, Donner finally got his big break here. The film earned $78 million worldwide, becoming a huge box office success. While it initially received mixed reviews, its reputation grew with time and it has been named as one of the best horror films of the 1970s. It would spawn a franchise, but Donner didn't return for the director's chair. Why? He was preparing for something super.

- **Worldwide gross:** $78,722,980.

#**Superman (1978)**

*""You'll believe a man can fly.""*

His fifth film. Based on the DC Comics character, it stars Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Jeff East, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, Jack O'Halloran, Maria Schell, and Sarah Douglas. It depicts the origin of Superman, including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton, son of Jor-El, and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane while battling the villainous Lex Luthor.

Ilya Salkind had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973, and he bought the rights with his father Alexander the following year. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film *Superman* and *Superman II* back-to-back, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. To show how serious he was, Alexander hired Mario Puzo (*The Godfather*) and paid him $600,000 to write the script. 

Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, William Friedkin, Richard Lester, Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Ilya wanted to hire Steven Spielberg to direct, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to ""wait until [Spielberg's] big fish opens."" His film, *Jaws*, became the highest grossing film ever, and the Salkinds offered him the job, but by that point Spielberg chose to make *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* instead. Guy Hamilton was hired, but left before filming due to legal issues. After seeing *The Omen*, the producers offered the job to Donner. He was planning to direct the *Omen* sequel, but decided to take *Superman* instead. Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite to start from scratch. According to Mankiewicz, ""not a word from the Puzo script was used.""

Before Donner signed, the film already cast Marlon Brando as Jor-El in 1975. And his terms were insane; top billing, a salary of $3.7 million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits (totaling $19 million), and his scenes had to be filmed in 12 days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later, getting a $2 million salary. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage ""because they would be committed to other films immediately.""

The first plan was for a famous star to play Superman, although Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Sylvester Stallone and Paul Newman all declined. When Donner signed, he decided to get an unknown actor. Reeve was suggested, but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny. When other actors weren't convincing, they decided to give a screen test to Reeve. They wanted him to wear a muscle suit, but Reeve instead decided to take a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. After gaining enough weight, he was cast. Compared to Brando and Hackman, Reeve was paid just $250,000 for *Superman* and its sequel. 

Filming began in March 1977, and it lasted 19 months because they were filming two films. The budget was $55 million ($303 million adjusted), which made it the most expensive film by that point. Warner Bros. only planned to distribute the film in North America, but was so impressed by the Krypton sequence, that they decided to distribute it worldwide. It was supposed to last eight months, but there were conflicts on set. 

Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and producer Pierre Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on *The Three Musketeers* and *The Four Musketeers*, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. On his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, ""At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him."" Due to this, they decided to stop filming back-to-back with the sequel, and Donner was assigned to finish the first film. By that point, 75% was already shot by Donner. 

The film opened with $7.4 million in its first weekend, despite playing at just 508 theaters, breaking a record for Warner Bros. As it expanded, it earned $10.3 million in its third weekend, which was the biggest weekend in history. Through the December 22-28 week, it earned a colossal $18.5 million, a figure that no film achieved in just 7 days. It eventually closed its domestic run with $134 million. And WB was right in believing in its worldwide prospects, as the film earned a huge $300 million, becoming their highest grossing film. 

The film also received critical acclaim, and it has been named as one of the best films of the 1970s. It won a Special Oscar for its Visual Effects. The film was deemed a cultural landmark for comic books, and it has been proclaimed by many as perhaps the most influential comic book film ever. For the world finally believed that, indeed, a man could fly. 

With this, Superman was finally an icon on the big screen. While Donner filmed 75% of *Superman II*, he was controversially fired before resuming his duties. There would be more Superman films in subsequent years (including one next year), but none have captured the cultural zeitgeist that this one achieved. 

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $134,478,449. ($646.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $300,478,449.

#**Inside Moves (1980)**

*""It'll make you feel good, and that ain't bad.""*

His sixth film. Based on the novel by Todd Walton, it stars John Savage, David Morse, Diana Scarwid, and Amy Wright. It follows a man who became crippled after a failed suicide attempt, and he turns to drink, favoring a local dive bar frequented by the handicapped. There, he befriends the bartender, an ex-basketball player saving up for corrective surgery in hopes of returning to the court, and meets a kind young lady who aids him with his physical and mental rehabilitation.

Donner states that he agreed to direct the film only to take his mind off being fired and replaced from *Superman II*. He referred to the film as ""the smallest film I could do that was just very near and dear to me, at that point, and I felt this is going to take my mind totally off that.""

It received mixed reviews, and made just $1.2 million at the box office.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,200,000. ($4.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,200,000.

#**The Toy (1982)**

*""When Jackie Gleason told his son he could have any present he wanted, he picked the most outrageous gift of all... Richard Pryor.""*

His seventh film. The film stars Richard Pryor, Jackie Gleason and Scott Schwartz, and follows a janitor at a department store. The owner's son is told that he may have anything in the toy department. He chooses the janitor, who the owner pays to spend a week with the boy.

The film was panned by critics, and was named as one of the worst films of the year. But with $47 million at the box office, it was still a success.

- **Budget:** $17,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $47,118,057. ($153 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $47,118,057.

#**The Goonies (1985)**

*""Join the adventure.""*

His eighth film. The film stars Sean Astin, Josh Brolin, Jeff Cohen, Corey Feldman, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Ke Huy Quan, John Matuszak, Anne Ramsey, Robert Davi, Joe Pantoliano and Mary Ellen Trainor. In the film, a group of kids who live in the ""Goon Docks"" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon, attempt to save their homes from foreclosure and, in doing so, they discover an old treasure map that takes them on an adventure to unearth the long-lost fortune of One-Eyed Willy, a legendary 17th-century pirate. During the adventure, they are pursued by a family of criminals who want the treasure for themselves.

Donner noted both the difficulties and pleasures of working with so many child actors. He praised them for their energy and excitement, but also said that they were also unruly when brought together. While Donner is credited as the director, some have referred to producer Steven Spielberg as co-director. 

The film received a great response, and after a slate of weak films, Donner bounced back with a much needed box office hit. The film was very influential, and it helped launch the careers of many of its stars.

- **Budget:** $19,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $63,711,145. ($185.6 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $124,311,145.

#**Ladyhawke (1985)**

*""A magical adventure.""*

His ninth film. The film stars Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer. The story is about a young thief who becomes unwillingly involved with a warrior and his lady who are hunted by the Bishop of Aquila. As he learns about the couple's past and secret, he chooses to help them overcome the Bishop's forces, and to lift an infernal curse.

It received mixed reviews, and it failed to recoup its $20 million budget.

- **Budget:** $20,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $18,432,000. ($53.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $18,432,000.

#**Lethal Weapon (1987)**

*""Two cops. Glover carries a weapon. Gibson is one. He's the only L.A. cop registed as a...""*

His tenth film. It stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Tom Atkins, Darlene Love, and Mitchell Ryan. The film follows a pair of mismatched LAPD detectives ‚Äî Martin Riggs, a former Green Beret who has become suicidal following the death of his wife, and veteran officer and family man Roger Murtaugh ‚Äî who work together as partners.

Recent UCLA graduate Shane Black wrote the screenplay in mid-1985. Black stated that his intention was to do an ""urban western"" inspired by *Dirty Harry* where a violent character ""reviled for what he did, what he is capable of, the things he believed in"" is eventually recruited for being the one that could solve the problem. His first draft was quite different from the final film; it was darker in tone and it included massive action scale sequences. The ending of the script contained a chase scene with helicopters and a trailer truck full of cocaine exploding over Hollywood Hills with cocaine snowing over the Hollywood sign.

The script was rejected by some studios, but Warner Bros. took an interest. Producer Joel Silver was brought in and worked with Black to further develop the script. Donner also brought in writer Jeffrey Boam to do some uncredited re-writes on Black's script after he found parts of it to be too dark. Donner got Gibson involved, while someone else suggested Danny Glover. After a successful screen test, the film was greenlit. 

The film was a huge hit, earning $120 million worldwide and continued launching the careers of Gibson and Glover, even if they already had a few recognizable titles by that point. It also received very positive reviews, and was another prime example of the buddy cop genre. Another Donner W.

- **Worldwide gross:** $120,207,127.

#**Scrooged (1988)**

*""The spirits will move you in odd and hysterical ways.""*

His 11th film. Based on the novella *A Christmas Carol* by Charles Dickens, it stars Bill Murray, Karen Allen, John Forsythe, John Glover, Bobcat Goldthwait, Carol Kane, Robert Mitchum, Michael J. Pollard, and Alfre Woodard. The film is a modern retelling that follows Frank Cross, a cynical and selfish television executive who is visited by a succession of ghosts on Christmas Eve intent on helping him regain his Christmas spirit.

After *Ghostbusters*, Murray only took a brief appearance in *Little Shop of Horrors* and chose to take a break. When he did feel a desire to return to acting, he said the ""scripts were just not that good"", and he returned to the this project as he found the idea of making a funny Scrooge appealing. Murray was paid $6 million for his role. He helped the writers, Mitch Glazer and Michael O'Donoghue, in rewriting. 

Murray struggled with a scene where he reveals his redemption live on TV. Wanting a central acting moment, however, Murray gave an emotional and intense performance, deviating from his marked positions and improvising his speech. Glazer and O'Donoghue thought that the actor was suffering a mental breakdown. After he was finished, the crew applauded Murray, but O'Donoghue remarked ""What was that? The Jim Jones hour?"" Donner turned and punched O'Donoghue in the arm, leaving him bruised for a week.

Despite the commitment, however, there was drama behind the scenes. Murray said that while he was enjoying the experience of the script and having fun as ""the meanest person in the world"", he found the production ""sloppy"" and has expressed unhappiness with the final cut. For his part, O'Donoghue later said that Donner did not understand comedy, omitting the script's subtler elements for louder and faster moments. He estimated that only 40% of his and Glazer's original script made it into the final film and the surviving content was ""twisted"". Murray was also not content with Donner, ""*Scrooged* could have been a really, really great movie. The script was so good... He kept telling me to do things louder, louder, louder. I think he was deaf."" Donner, meanwhile, has a much more positive memory of Murray, calling him ""superbly creative but occasionally difficult - as difficult as any actor.""

The film received polarizing reactions, particularly for the tone. But as it was Murray's follow-up to *Ghostbusters*, it made $100 million worldwide, making it a box office success. In subsequent years, it has become a Christmas classic. 

- **Budget:** $32,000,000.

- **Worldwide gross:** $100,328,558.

#**Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)**

*""The magic is back.""*

His 12th film. The second installment in the *Lethal Weapon* franchise, it stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Joss Ackland, Derrick O'Connor and Patsy Kensit. In the film, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh protect an irritating federal witness, Leo Getz, while taking on a gang of South African drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity.

After the first film's success, Joel Silver asked Shane Black to write a sequel. Although he was struggling with personal issues, Black still managed to write the first draft along with his friend, novelist Warren Murphy. Although many people thought that their script was brilliant, it was rejected by Silver, Donner and the studio for being too dark and bloody, and because in the ending of the script Riggs dies, while they wanted to keep him alive in case of further sequels. They also wanted the second film to focus more on comedy, while Black's draft focused more on courage and heroics, like Riggs willing to die to protect Murtaugh and his family, due to his love for them.

When his script was rejected, Black felt that he had failed the producers. Black refused to re-write the script and quit from the project after working for six months on it. Black later said how the problem with the second film was that they did too much comedy, and how he dislikes the third and fourth films because of the way Riggs's character was changed. Donner got Jeffrey Boam back to rewrite, and one of the biggest changes was expanding Leo Getz's character. 

The film received very great reviews, and saw a big increase from the original, earning $227 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $147,253,986. ($372.3 million adjusted)

#**Radio Flyer (1992)**

*""Powered by imagination.""*

His 13th film. The film stars Lorraine Bracco, John Heard, Elijah Wood, Joseph Mazzello, Adam Baldwin, and Ben Johnson and is narrated by Tom Hanks. Two young boys try to transform their toy into an airplane after their stepfather turns abusive. They wish to escape the physical abuse and fly away to safety.

The film received negative reviews, and it barely got 10% of its budget. Luckily for Donner, he had another film for that year.

- **Budget:** $35,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,651,977. ($10.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $4,651,977.

#**Lethal Weapon 3 (1992)**

*""The magic is back again.""*

His 14th film. The third installment in the *Lethal Weapon* franchise, it stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, and Stuart Wilson. In the film, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh pursue Jack Travis, a former LAPD lieutenant turned ruthless arms dealer, during the six days prior to Murtaugh's retirement. Riggs and Murtaugh are joined by Leo Getz as well as internal affairs Sergeant Lorna Cole.

Jeffrey Boam's first two drafts of the script were different from the final film. The character of Lorna for example was not a woman in original drafts, but the original character still had the same personality and was just as lethal and crazy as Riggs, making him his match. Riggs also had an affair with Roger's daughter Rianne, and a few parts in the final film where Roger suspects that Riggs and Rianne are interested in each other are only parts left from the original drafts. Donner demanded some big changes on the script which included changing the original character of Lorna into a woman and turning her into Riggs's girlfriend. He also re-worked the script to be less story-oriented and not focus on the main villains but instead on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh. He also toned down action scenes from the script and brought back Leo Getz into the story. All of his scenes were written in afterwards.

The film received mixed reviews and was considered as weaker than the previous films. But it still earned $320 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing film in the franchise and Donner's highest grossing film (although *Superman* still has that title adjusted for inflation). 

- **Budget:** $35,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $144,731,527. ($323.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $321,731,527.

#**Maverick (1994)**

*""In their hands, a deck of cards was the only thing more dangerous than a gun.""*

His 15th film. Based on the 1957‚Äì1962 television series, it stars Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and James Garner (who starred in the original series). The film follows Bret Maverick, a card player and con artist who collects money in order to enter a high-stakes poker game. He is joined in his adventure by Annabelle Bransford, another con artist, and Marshal Zane Cooper, a lawman.

The film received positive reviews, and was another great success at the box office, earning $183 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $75,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $101,631,272. ($215 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $183,031,272.

#**Assassins (1995)**

*""In the shadows of life, in the business of death, one man found a reason to live...""*

His 16th film. The film stars Sylvester Stallone, Antonio Banderas, and Julianne Moore. Professional hit-man Robert Rath wants to fulfill a few more contracts before retiring but unscrupulous ambitious newcomer hit-man Miguel Bain keeps killing Rath's targets.

The film was panned by critics, and was a box office flop.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $30,303,072. ($62.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $83,306,268.

#**Conspiracy Theory (1997)**

*""Jerry Fletcher sees conspiracies everywhere... one has turned out to be true. Now his enemies want him dead. And she's the only one he can trust.""*

His 17th film. It stars Mel Gibson, Julia Roberts and Patrick Stewart, and centers on an eccentric taxi driver who believes many world events are triggered by government conspiracies, and the Justice Department attorney who becomes involved in his life. 

The film received mixed reviews, and despite earning $137 million worldwide, it wasn't a box office success due to its high budget.

- **Budget:** $80,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $75,982,834. ($148.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $136,982,834.

#**Lethal Weapon 4 (1998)**

*""The gang's all here.""*

His 18th film. The fourth and final installment in the *Lethal Weapon* franchise, it stars Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Rene Russo, Chris Rock, and Jet Li. It follows Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh as they investigate a Chinese immigrant smuggling ring. A crime boss named Benny Chan leads them to the Chinatown.

Wanting another film in the franchise, Warner Bros. and Joel Silver tried buying a new spec script titled *Simon Says* in hopes of rewriting it into a script for *Lethal Weapon 4*. Written by Jonathan Hensleigh, the story was about a police detective and a shop owner forced to find and stop bombs planted all over a city as part of a mad bomber's revenge plot against the detective. 20th Century Fox then bought the script, and decided to use it as the basis for a new *Die Hard* film, *Die Hard with a Vengeance*. Donner was committed to another film, but Gibson was not interested. 

The film had a very difficult pre-production, as the script was still being re-written and rejected. Silver ultimately brought in TV writer Channing Gibson to work on the script, after he was impressed by Gibson's rewrite of a spec script titled *Sandblast*. Gibson took the gig thinking it would be a more relaxed writing job than anything he did for TV. However, much like the previous two sequels, the script kept getting changed and rewritten over and over again. Gibson would end up doing more work and revisions on it than on all of his TV work put together. Production even started with only half of the script. 

Something you might have noticed, is that the budget was far larger than the previous films. While the previous two films cost $30-$35 million, *Lethal Weapon 4* had a budget of... $150 million ($288 million adjusted). Which means that at that point, it was the most expensive R-rated film ever and the third most expensive film, just behind *Titanic* and *Waterworld*. Why? Because the delays kept coming... but Warner Bros. was desperate in greenlighting the film. Realizing they had no big tentpole releases scheduled for summer 1998, Warner Bros. finally greenlit the film in late 1997. So they opened all their wallets and started shooting in January 1998, despite having one third of the film not written yet, including the ending. Due to issues during filming, including the script changes, production ended around mid May, less than two months before its scheduled July release. The ending was not written until it was finally time to film it. Editors had to work very quickly to have the film ready, which is why the trailers feature some deleted and alternate scenes which are not in the film. So the film was greenlit, filmed and released in theaters in the span of just 7 months. 

The film received mixed reviews. And if Warner Bros. was confident that spending $150 million to rush a film was worth it, they were in for a rude awakening. The film earned just $285 million worldwide, which meant that the film was a box office flop. 

It was the last film in the franchise. Although a gang in a pub in Philadelphia kept the spirit alive by making three sequels, one of which had Danny DeVito as the bad guy. 

- **Budget:** $150,000,000.

#**Timeline (2003)**

*""You're history.""*

His 19th film. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, it stars Paul Walker, Frances O'Connor, Gerard Butler, Billy Connolly, David Thewlis, and Anna Friel. It follows a team of present-day archaeology and history students who are sent back in time to medieval France to rescue their professor from the middle of a battle.

The film was a critical and commercial failure.

#**16 Blocks (2006)**

*""1 Witness... 118 Minutes.""*

His 20th and final film. It stars Bruce Willis, Mos Def, and David Morse. The film unfolds in the real time narration method, and follows Jack, who is assigned the task of escorting Eddie, a witness, from police custody to the courthouse. However, when they are attacked on the way, Jack learns that the entire NYPD wants Eddie dead.

The film received mixed reviews, and it marked his fifth bomb in a row. It was his final film before his death in 2021.

He made 20 films, but only 18 have reported box office numbers. Across those 18 films, he made $2,146,151,267 worldwide. That's $119,230,625 per film.

#**The Verdict**

Despite the inconsistency of his filmography, it's hard to deny Donner as a very influential figure of cinema. 

He was an expert in handling many genres; you'd expect the director of *The Goonies* to make 4 *Lethal Weapon* films? Or that the guy who made *The Omen* would make *Scrooged*? Sure, his last films indicated that he might have lost it, but you can't blame him for trying. The fact that he was willing to make *Lethal Weapon 5* before his death show he was very committed. He was never too old for this shit. 

And of course, there's *Superman*. The film that changed comic book films as we know them. It wasn't the first, but it was perhaps the most influential. There's an argument that either *Batman*, *The Dark Knight*, *Iron Man*, *The Avengers*, *Deadpool* or *Joker* are more influential, but those films wouldn't exist today if it wasn't for Donner. It's why Kevin Feige shows the film to all the cast and crew before filming any MCU film. If the film was put in the careless hands of a mediocre director, it would've been forgotten almost immediately. And the genre would be very different today. So it's a testament to the strength of the film of how much it could change the landscape of what was possible. He and Christopher Reeve really offered something fresh and exciting. They truly made the world believe a man could fly.

The next director will be **Ang Lee**. A very important filmmaker.  

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... >!Roland Emmerich.!< Is it Joever for him? 

This is the schedule for the following four:

Week | Director | Reasoning
:-------:|:--------:|----------
June 3-9 | Ang Lee | What happened to Lee?
June 10-16 | Zack Snyder | RIP Inbox.
June 17-23 | Tony Scott | Action films have not been the same ever since his death. 
June 24-30 | Roland Emmerich | The King of disaster films. 

Who should be next after Emmerich? That's up to you. But there's a catch.

For this week, you'll choose from four options, all picked by me. So we won't accept any other suggestions this week. I'll give you four directors, and the director with the most upvotes will get his own post. And here they are:

- Joe Dante: Like Donner, a very influential figure of the 70s and 80s. 

- Renny Harlin: One of the most popular directors with the biggest amount of flops. How does he do it?

- John McTiernan: An important action filmmaker... who literally went to jail. 

- Rob Reiner: Another actor who had an incredible run as a director, before falling with *North*.

So which one should be next? That's up to you.",29,60

With X-Men (2000) only making $296 million compared to Spider-Man's staggering $821 million. Even the highest grossing X-Men film, Days of Future Past only made $746 million, which is lower than The Amazing Spider-Man's $758 million, only the FOURTH highest grossing Spidey film at the time, and now the SEVENTH highest grossing Spider-Man. This is all especially weird considering just how huge the X-men were in the 90's, from the cartoon, to the comics to video games. So what's up with the difference ?",79,0

Dragon Boat Festival lands on a Monday this year so its a single day holiday linked to the weekend instead of a 3 day period. 

Its early June date this year which is a bit too soon for the summer season that starts at the end of the month means there's not really anything heavy hitting schedule for it but there will be a barage of small to mid sized local movies hitting alongside 2 Holywood movies in Civil War and Furiosa.

On Furiosa. It has still not started pre-sales with less than a week till release which is why its not in the chart.

The filmed crossed $137,289,000 WW back then, roughly 1.6x production budget. 

Now, in 1993, home video sales/VHS and Laserdisc rentals were a much more significant factor in terms of profitably. I have to believe with 3+ decades of home media and syndication rights, the film is profitable for Sony/Tristar.

* From the beginning of the century, we can see a good jumping back and forth among top grossers - 12-13 movies have respectable $300M+ grosses each year. Franchises were young, some were already done. Before that we have rarely grossers over $300M+. A behemoth as Titanic was alone at the top in 1997, because no other movies grossed $300M that year. Approaching the new century $300M grossers became more apparent. Since 2000 we had 8-10+ movies grossing $300M. 
* Mid 00s passed by and came 2007 - a sudden spike - 3 more movies grossed $300M+ than the year prior. What gives? A lot of closures in trilogies - Pirates, Spider-Man, Shrek himself and strong ongoing performance from Harry Potter. All examples of leader in the market. 
* Then, another spike... a big one. The King of the Box Office is here. It's August 2009 and people saw the Cameron's Epos for the first time. No other came close (at least for another 10 years). The difference was beyond imagination. Consequent years saw also strong performances and Harry Potter reigned supremely one last time. As impressive this era was, it is dwarfed by what is coming next...

It's May 4th 2012 (Also Star Wars celebration day) and Marvel Studios pay-off has finally arrived. 

As  Deadline wrote it ['Avengers' Tracking Like Superhero: $125+M Opening Weekend With 4-Quadrant Appeal](https://deadline.com/2012/04/avengers-tracking-like-superhero-125m-opening-weekend-with-four-quadrant-appeal-255675/). There was sure an appeal. It was poised to open higher than Iron Man 2 (128M). How big, nobody knew at the time...

>***Right now Disney¬†and theatre owners are adding screens every day for the¬†release¬†whose online pre-sales of tickets are already selling out.¬†Midnight show business is expected to be phenomenal. Exactly how much the studio can gross for the first weekend depends on how many screenings each theater can pack into 72 hours by finding enough staff willing to work the extra hours and keep the pic running continuously.*** 

It's interesting reading some of the comments under that article - many believed it will deliver, but not much more than what has already been done, few believed in the ""***B"",*** but none predicated what happened. 

* On May 4th, Friday, The Avengers opened to the second biggest Friday of All time, only behind Deathly Hallows Part 2. The rest you already know. 
* I firmly believe The Avengers was one of the most influential movies in 2010s and in the cinema history. There were big movies before it and after it, but it's simple promise is what made the blockbuster scene. Cameron still reigned supreme, not even with $200M+ openers, but he came once every 10 years or so. Marvel ""promised"" to have that level every year and did they deliver. 
* Since then, MCU was everywhere, talked, discussed, loved, hated but it was in people's mouths. The success of The Avengers might be remembered with giving the true birth of the shared universe and with so many failed attempts to copy it. What I think might be glazed over is the leading example it brought. Not in quality, but in blockbuster making. The 4-quadrant appeal was a great way to please everyone, and Hollywood saw that. It was nothing new, other movies were 4-quadrant, but never in such a big way. What Hollywood saw was the new path on how to make blockbusters. 
* What we had between 2012 and 2019 was the audiences having blast going to the theater. MCU was almost around the corner and in-between every other blockbuster. You either watch MCU movie and then some other blockbusters or you watch some other blockbuster in wait for the MCU movie. It was the perfect run - from opening and breaking the $200M barrier, to opening and breaking the $300M barrier and becoming at the time the King of The Box Office. 

&#x200B;

`And then COVID happened.`

* I'm not going to delve deep into pandemic years. The data clearly show that there are still leaders during that time. It's just that people show only for the leaders. And there were leaders before 2012 and MCU rising but the experience year to year was vastly different. One year you got Shrek, the next you got Harry Potter and then Pirates of the Caribbean. All big, all loved by audiences, but vastly different, with different target demos. What MCU got audiences accustomed to was familiarity - you got 2-3 big blockbusters every year and in the same overall greatness. The biggest critique MCU has - all movies feeling the same, General Audiences didn't care about. And I believe GA still doesn't care about that, but their familiarity has fallen off, because the MCU has fallen off. 
* The many factors surrounding the last 3-4 years are big part of the reason to where we are. Many points toward the rise of streaming and I agree it plays a role in shaping the experience. Everyday you are bombarded on social media with war and prejudices. The world feels a bit cold. Thanks to social media, distant problems become your problem in your head. You are bombarded with them... and then pops an ad - ""You can watch now this movie on this platform"". 
* It has been discussed many times over in the last 1-2 years about the changed habits of viewers. The main culprit is the created habit of waiting to go on digital/streaming and I believe that is partially true. I, myself has been experiencing this more recently whether or not to go watch a movie or skip it and wait it few weeks / months later, because I have to weight my own priorities. But I think it's more than creating a habit of ""I'll wait"". If that was true, that means all those who waited would have buy it/rent it on digital and all those movies would have been big and would have heard about it. But it is not like that. 

And this is why we need the box office leaders. The staples of blockbusters. Maybe not for you and me, who are interested in those topics and are familiar with it, but to general audiences, your everyday Joe who sometimes happen to stumble upon a movie which can caught his eye and go see it. 

As to why $300M thresholds - that I will leave for the brain. ",6,29

So you can see brand new movies for $5 a few days after they come out.

Fridays and Saturdays aren't very crowded at the theater usually, but tuesdays generally have a lot of traffic. 

Does this mean that even though its selling a lot of tickets, that the box office numbers only reflect that $5 discounted price? Or is there some sort of standardized value for a ""ticket"" that is used based on number of tickets sold?

Curious if something like a $5 tuesday is basically undercutting the movie studios just to get people in the door so the theater can make money with concessions.",15,17

The movie is at 38M DOM after 1 full week in theaters. It‚Äôs dead. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs gonna be a surge of people going to see it in theaters. It‚Äôs just bleeding money. So why keep it in theaters? 

They have fresh marketing all over social media from Chris Hemsworth and Anya Taylor Joy which they could use in their favor, plus they get to keep most of the $30 price tag these movies have when you purchase them on PVOD services. 

I‚Äôm not a movie studio fanatic. I think most of these companies are run by awful people, but let‚Äôs not kid ourselves, their business is literally making money. Every single studio is after that same goal‚Ä¶

Yes, they‚Äôre hurting themselves by creating a habit in people of waiting for movies to just hit streaming, but they also have to keep finding ways to make money. 

Besides, the habit is already there. Hollywood is a nonstop machine that has been shaped and reshaped for decades. It‚Äôs all about who adapts better. 

Maybe in 10 years we‚Äôll be back to 70 day windows, but it‚Äôs not likely to happen this year. ",126,103

#**Childrens Day(June 1st)**

Childrens Day this year only has 3 relevant releases. Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony continues the long term tradition of a Doraemon movie on Childrens day. There's been one every year since 2017 except 2020 during Covid. It technicaly releases tomorrow on the 31st but i'm using Saturday as a comparison for all 3 movies because its the Childrens Day itself.

Garfield hits over $1M in pre-sales for its opening day. Really good last day pushes opening day projections up to $4.5M+. Weekend could push upwards of $6M+

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 


**Dragon Boat Festival(June 10th):**

The Dragon Boat Festival lands on a Monday this year which means its gonna be a single day holiday linked to the weekend.

Ex - Roadside Attractions, Vertical Entertainment, etc","For the big studios, when a movie flops, it does not seem as big of a deal.  These studios afford 200M + budgets, have flashy advertising campaigns and afford big names. Or sometimes the theatrical release is a bonus to help the streaming debut at some point.  

But how do the small distributors survive?  There are some of Roadside Attractions's last movies - Boy Kills World, Absence of Eden, Asphalt City, The Marsh King's Daughter. 

I understand there are co-distribution deals worked out, same day digital release and eventually, these movies are available for free on online streaming services.  The theatrical rollouts are also not as big as other movies.  2000 theatres as a maximum on opening weekend.  But this is for one weekend and the drops are big.  Boy Kills World, by its third weekend of release, was only playing in 40 theatres!  

Sometimes it is joked about that the death of any new movie is if they go to a distributor like these.  Chris Pine's new movie Poolman was distributed by Vertical , releasing in under 200 theatres in the United States (dont even think Canada got this one).  As expected, it made peanuts with a worldwide gross under $160,000.  ",4,8

Ik it's not really a clear indication how its gonna do box office-wise, but if you look at the most viewed trailers in 24 hours of all time, *almost all* are highly beloved IPs (Moana is no different) and went to do insane huge numbers. 

Inside Out 2 also debuted with high number of views (157M), but I'll wait till it comes out. KFP 4 also debuted with huge 142M views, but I found its performance unimpressive considering it had fanbase hyping it (although I didn't really see the hype outside the fanbase), but it was a success nonetheless.

I just compared it to Incredibles 2 because they almost made similar figures (Incredibles- 631M, Moana- 643M) and could possibly replicate I2's performance. If it managed to be better than what Frozen 2 offered us, I think it could do a heft jump. Mind you Moana has been consistent at the top of most watched movies on Disney+, it has The Rock, and no controversies. But Disney's reputation is in a rough spot right now, and it was originally a series, which means it could be bad. The songs will be crucial for this one. I think good songs might save it from a so-so story tho (*ala* Encanto).

I wanna know your insights.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Ezra**

- katnisscinnaplex (THU:  - Mack & Rita - .627x. | I personally don't factor lower location counts into the estimates in too much as long as it's getting a wide release of at least 1k.  The busiest and best selling locations will be covered and a lot of time it's the smaller theaters that don't get these (and they don't bring in much money anyway).  Any bigger city would have at least a few places where people could go see it instead. | THU: - Queenpins - .326x. Mack & Rita - .484x **(May 30)**. Thursday Previews: Queenpins - .75x. Mack & Rita - .643x **(May 29)**.)

**Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle Average THU Comps/Predictions: $1.31M/$1.05M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.34M THU comp. I am pretty sure Demon Slayer underperformed here, and I am inclined to go with my more recent data. I'l go with $1.2 Million, +/- 0.2, but really shooting darts here **(May 29)**. No movement, probs looking at around $1 Million previews (May 28). Not bad, not bad (May 27).)

- Flip (Looking at some theaters near me, Haikyu is outselling Spy x Family (May 20).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.74M THU SizeAdjusted+GrowthModel comp.  I'm a little conflicted because the last few days have been better than Spy X, but that's one of the highest comps.  Just to be safe, I'm going to average the two smaller releases (Spy X and Suzume) to get ~750k previews. | Pace has been pretty close to most of the anime comps, and much better than Spy x Family.   Right now I'm thinking this ends up around 750k **(May 30)**.)

- Relevation ($1.86M THU Comp. Two incredible over indexes on this slow May weekend, with Haikyu managing by far the best anime movie sales total at my theater thus far. Do feel that it lands much closer to Spy x Family than Demon Slayer tho, so I'll throw something like $1.2-1.3M THU, and a $7-8M OW **(May 29)**.)

- Rorschach (No major movement today **(May 29)**. These numbers seem pretty damn good. Will echo @abracadabra1998's $1 mil previews prediction (May 28).)

**In a Violent Nature Average THU Comps/Predictions: $0.65M/$0.46M**

- el sid (Had today for today 263 sold tickets. Comps (all films counted on Thursday of the release week for Thursday): From 7 films (Thanksgiving, X, The Invitation, The First Omen, The Strangers: Chapter One, Tarot and Abigail) the preview number is 750k for In a Violent Nature.  But I see several problems: #1 its sales are uneven. The presales in LA are way better than elsewhere.  #2 the comp from X (440k from previews) is only 350k. #3 the location count. #4 the reaction from the moviegoers on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb are very mixed. Some liked the film very much but many other said it's boring and that it soon becomes tiresome to see (almost?) the whole film from the killer's perspective. With all those problems I think 750k could be too optimistic and go with 400k **(May 30)**. Had also only showtimes in 4 of the 7 theaters but already 123 sold tickets. So where it gets shows, it does fine. Loose comps, all counted on Monday of the release week for Thursday: Tarot (715k from previews) had 97 sold tickets in 5 theaters, The Invitation (775k from previews) had 96 in 7 theaters, Pearl (1.3M OD) had 102 sold tickets in 6 theaters and The Strangers: Chapter One (1.2M from previews) had 215 sold tickets in 6 theaters (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.41M THU SizeAdjusted+GrowthModel comp. EA could contribute close to 100k so I'll go with 450k total. | I'm sticking closely to the Soho comp since that had a similar heavy EA skew.  Going with 600k for now **(May 30)**.)

- Relevation ($1.08M THU comp.  Two incredible over indexes on this slow May weekend.  In A Violent Nature doing great things too, juuuuust barely eeking past the Strangers to become the best selling horror movie ever at my theater, as an IFC movie! Again hate to be the pessimist tho, but Winnie 2 is probably the best comp as a niche indie horror film. $500K-750K THU and a $5-7M OW? **(May 29)**.)

- Rorschach ($0.34M THU comp and $1.29M THU+FRI comp. Thursday received a nice little bump, though Friday is still stationary **(May 29)**)

**Summer Camp**

- el sid (Had today full 14 sold tickets (with shows in 5 of the 7 theaters). Comp: The Book Club 2 (550k from previews/6.7M OW) had also on Thursday for Thursday 31 sold tickets. Well, with so few tickets sold (and interested moviegoers noticing that there's no need to preorder tickets because the theaters are empty) it's rather a wild guess than a prediction. Because of the reminder that Book Club 2 got ~ 3.500 theaters and Summer Camp only ~ 1.600, I would say Summer Camp could get ca. 200k from previews and maybe 2-3M OW **(May 30)**. Has shows in 3 of my 7 theaters and had not more than 7 sold tickets. So so far completely under the radar. Comp: Book Club 2 (6.7M OW) had also on Monday for Thursday 25 sold tickets in 5 theaters (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex (THU: - Mack & Rita - .667x. House Party - .286x. Family Camp - .486x. | Mack & Rita - .968x. House Party - .492x. Family Camp - .517x. Queenpins - .652x **(May 30)**. Thursday previews: Mack & Rita - 1.357x. House Party - .422x. Family Camp - .345x. Queenpins - 1.583x **(May 29)**.)

- Relevation ($0.00M Thursday comp.  lmao at Summer Camp, not even one ticket sold across all 5 of its showtimes. Not even gonna bother with trying to guess, zero data for it and no real comp utility either **(May 29)**.)

**Young Woman and the Sea**

- JonathanMB (I just checked showtimes near me, and in the entire Chicago suburbs it looks like it's only in 5-7 theaters for Friday. Also randomly enough it has a couple of showtimes today at 3pm at some random AMCs? Looks like they're 30-50% full (May 27).)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.85M/$5.10M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $2.61M THU. All these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18 so that'll go down. Feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find good comps (May 19). Numbers are from last THU, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- el sid (Counted yesterday for Thursday had 395 sold tickets with shows in 6 theaters (the small AMC Lakeline in Texas is still missing). 10 days left. Bad Boys for Life (6.36M from previews) had on Monday of the release week 915 sold tickets = 43% at the moment for Bad Boys 4 with 7 days left to come closer or maybe overtake. My guess is that BB4 could have 800-1000k tickets by next Monday, so it could be pretty much on par with BBfL. Similar to other reports here: BB4 does not have stellar presales and after several disappointments I shouldn't exaggerate but compared to the best comps it looks quite good for BB4 as you can see (May 28).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $5.1M EA+THU.)

- keysersoze123 (Still at very low pace **(May 30)**. Presales are again not that much at this point. I think its not going to hit the heights of last movie (May 28). It should start to amp up sometime this week (May 27). This wont be fan driven. Even the last one initially trailed Dr Do little in presales but amped up big time close to release. | This will be a late bloomer. I am still expecting 50m+ OW (May 23).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $5.35M THU. Excellent jump today. Starting to see the acceleration **(May 29)**. Steady pace, no acceleration yet. Switch to G x K since that had super strong walkups ($6.12M THU comp) and Bad Boys 4 will likely replicate this (May 27). Comps ($4.11M) would mean $40M+ Opening Weekend (May 24). Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- TwoMisfits (Aging male-skewing franchises tend to get the biggest bump from this deal. Folks are on the fence but know what they are getting. Female skewing non-sequel ones tend to get zero help.  You need baseline interest to get people willing to pay anything, b/c these still are $5.  The other effect of the deal is that movies releasing around the $5 hits sometimes get hurt. | June TMobile $5 Atom movie. This could help it go huge, like last year's Spider-Verse (May 22).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.6M THU. A bounceback day that helped undo some of the damage from earlier this week **(May 29)**. It's not having a great week. It's slowly slipping against comps, when the hope was that it would be gaining. New showtimes went up for the Thursday, and it's only gotten one additional screen. It's the 4DX screen, which makes sense, as what else justifies a 4DX screen at this stage **(May 29)**. It's staying pretty flat (May 28). Zero sales day when all comps seemed to have done well. Not a great result. Note: This isn't a holiday weekend in Canada, so that doesn't explain the slow sales. Hopefully it's just an anomaly. This has been very steady to date (May 27). Ghostbusters and Apes both went up in comps, but I didn't have Hunger Games included, so it's brought the average down. Still, its growing at a steady pace (May 26). I still expect this to be more walk up friendly than the comps being used, and should see a gradual rise as the date gets closer (May 25). Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20). Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. Very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

- YM! (Like IO2 the pace for Bad Boys is small but mighty. EA is only available at Majestic much like Garfield. With EA, it‚Äôs a few tickets shy of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 but without them it‚Äôs only a bit over half. Either way both is really good. I think we‚Äôll continue to see the gap grow over the week but as of rn, I am thinking around $6-7m previews without EA solely on vibes to an OW north of $55m (May 25). Same thing as IO2 for Bad Boys (see May 23 IO2 comment), I expect this to not only skew more GA friendly and should bulk up ticket sales as we get closer to release. It‚Äôs almost at half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 which is a pretty great thing. Should easily outdo it by T-6 imho (May 23). Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

**The Watchers Average Thursday Comp: $0.89M**

- el sid (Had a pretty muted start in my theaters. Yesterday 37 tickets were sold for Thursday, May 6, and today it were 44 (with showtimes in 5 theaters). Comps (always counted for Thursday):Tarot (715k from previews) had with 6 days left 28 sold tickets. The First Omen (725k) had with 8 days left also 28 sold tickets. Abigail (1M) had with 6 days left 97 sold tickets. And The Strangers: Chapter One (1.2M) had on Monday of the release week 215 sold tickets.  I don't think that The Watchers can reach the presales number of The Strangers, maybe half of that (= ca. 100 sold tickets next Monday). So at the moment I go with around 500k from previews for The Watchers **(May 30)**.)

- filmlover (Hasn't sold anything near me (May 26).)

- Flip (These are good numbers considering it‚Äôs only playing in 2/3 theaters I track (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.89M THU Comp.)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Fellowship of the Ring (269 tickets, 6 showtimes, 4 theaters) on Saturday, June 8, 2024 and Saturday, June 15, 2024 (21 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). The Two Towers (243 tickets, 4 theaters) Saturday, June 9, 2024 and Saturday, June 16, 2024 (22 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). Return of the King (281 tickets, 4 theaters) for Saturday, June 10, 2024 and Saturday, June 17, 2024 (16 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). 852 tickets sold in total. 793 tickets sold for the first week. 59 tickets sold for the second week (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $8.65M**

- NRG (Now tracking for $85M domestic debut **(May 30)**.)

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $3.98M THU. Good update, hopefully this keeps on rising (May 23). Not impressed at all so far here sadly (May 19).)

- AniNate (Finally a little movement here. 23 Thursday, 52 Fri-Sun (compared to 18 THU and 23 FRI-SUN on May 17) (May 22). Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Some growth for THU, not bad but I expect sales to increase steadily as we get closer to release day. The presales are good enough to not be a disaster like Garfield, but not big enough to guarantee a 100m opening. I still like what I‚Äôm seeing though. As my local theater has finally shown some signs of life with this film. 5 tickets sold. Way better than Garfield at the same point. | The numbers might not be completely accurate, but it‚Äôs looking extremely strong for Friday. 900 tickets for the five theaters I track. Maybe even 1,286 tickets if my numbers are accurate. That tells me this is not front loaded whatsoever. Or at the very least not preview heavy (May 27). Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the THU previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on THU for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder (Comp: $12.33M THU at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27). Fan event on the 16th has 43 tickets sold from 2 showtimes (compared to 8 showtimes and 73 tickets sold for previews), so that might be depressing previews a bit.)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $6.37M THU. Early sales haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18).)

- keysersoze123 (If you compare this to any animation movies seen recently including Minions, its doing very well.  | Really good this far out for sure (May 25). Chugging along at this point (May 19). Show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $8.65M THU.   I literally have zero good comps for IO2 right now.  I generally don't keep track of sub-5m pure kids animated films until right before release (if even then), so the exact genre matches are out. IO2 is too backloaded (or rather NOT frontloaded) for the AtSVs of the world to make much sense. IO2 had a (too) long (by half) pre-sale window which is wrecking a whole bunch of other slightly more plausible comps. If I had a complete track of KFP4, that'd probably help a great deal. So I have a ton of.... less than ideal comps where none of them are probably point in the right direction.  Maaaaaaaybe Wonka might be the best of the bad batch there.   But, as often the case with films that should be very backloaded, won't really know how backloaded they are until the week of release. (will note that IO2 does seem to be picking up a hint of steam right now.  Which should bode well for its overall ticket total). | Horror is, along side pure kids animation, THE most backloaded genre there is when it comes to pre-sales.  The ATP for the Nope comp will be wrecked (and then some), but the pace should be very instructive. It also helps that the name recognition for Jordan Peele led to slightly stronger than usual pre-sales for a non-franchise horror installment which should map fairly well with the in-built name recognition of IO2. Is complicated by the fact that Nope had an even longer pre-sale window than IO2, but that might help counterbalance some of the ATP errors involved. Won't be a good comp at the end.  But right now, might be one of the better ones, especially to show the insane growth that should be on the table for IO2.  I don't think it's much of a coincidence that it's one of the few comps I have right now that is pointing to double digit previews **(May 30)**. I don't agree with the undertone of concern when it comes to ticket sales for IO2.  They seem perfectly fine to me, maybe even somewhat strong.  It just isn't selling like a frontloaded CBM/fan driven franchise (even when adjusting for animation). So I suppose it really comes down to how much we think this will still act like a traditional kids animation film when it comes to buying pattern, how much demand has been burnt off, and how many people are still going to buy tickets but see no particular need to buy them early. Which I suppose really can't be answered until we get close to the time when kids animation films typically accelerate.  But, I keep looking at the sales in Sacramento and not seeing much cause for concern. Yet, at any rate (May 25). Decided to add Nope ($12.62M) to the comp block.  Not because I think it's a particularly good one (the ATP differences alone are a major red flag), but more for pace considerations considering how similar horror and kids animation are when it comes to being backloaded.  The other consideration with Nope is that it was on sale for nearly two weeks longer, so it did have a small amount of extra time to pad some seats sold.  But maybe the errors (ATP vs length of pre-sale) will cancel each other out.  PROBABLY NOT!  But the pace at the very least should be interesting (May 25).  10.0% Matinee sales, 5.3% 3D sales and 42.2% PLF sales. (May 19). Strange pre-sale pattern. Was there some sort of promo that dropped today?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (May 16). On the SAT of release weekend (NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost OW slightly depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- Skim Beeble (I don't know if it's just me, but starting June 20th PLF showings for Inside Out 2 are stopping after around 4 PM. Is there possibly a surprise release coming or is it just a scheduling showtime thing from the chains. (This is AMC) **(May 29)**.)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $8.52M THU Florida and $7.57M THU Orlando Comp. Excellent pace this far out. Does feel like something big is around the corner (May 27). Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18).)

- vafrow (Comp: $12.5M THU. Take the comps with a grain of salt. The low numbers on IF and Garfield really throw things off. Numbers were flat all week before a jump in the last day **(May 29)**. It's starting to grow (May 25). I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19). No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of PLFs, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16).)

- YM! (Using Keysersoze123's earlier MTC1 data, the pace is pretty good. $6.74M average THU comp. The same caveats apply (higher ATP than the other animations due to older skew and PLFs but having lower ATP than TLM as that skews older and likely has more of audience to buy upfront, and Wish being on Discount Tuesday muddies things up) but the important thing is that pace healthy and gainer ground against its comparisons. Feel like tracking is right on the money of 75-85m OW but could grow stronger if pace continues strong and reviews are strong (May 26). The pace is moving nicely as we have about two and a half weeks left. Think there‚Äôs potential for ticket count pace to grow strongly. I have no comparisons but it is at Garfield‚Äôs EA-less T-3 ticket sales. Going to probably not say much on preview predictions but my thoughts of an OW in between 75m-100m still stand. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out (May 25). Little has changed as IO2 keeps on trucking along. I do theorize at least from the 250 ticket selling Funko Event, it‚Äôs plausible families and fans went for that date instead of Thursday night previews. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out. At the very least, I like that it doubled its previous sales a week ago as it shows pace and outdid Garfield‚Äôs T-6 (May 23). Did some snooping around for the Funko Event as I was curious if perhaps families getting presales for the opening Saturday vs opening Thursday as those sales are kind of weak Thursday and uhm it‚Äôs at 250 tickets. Which is like 5 times Garfield‚Äôs EA showing of 50 tickets all at PLF prices despite normal theaters. Most of which at 9:30 AM with only one theater having it at 11:00 AM (May 22). Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M THU comp and $22.2M FRI comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True FRI although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the THU average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount TUES so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20). Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event. Pretty solid for what it is. Majestic is healthy and about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn (May 17).)

**The Bikeriders**

- Pinacolada (Actually sold some around me. It does seem like Focus is giving it kind of a shitty release though. Small screens. Definitely no PLFs, which 20th Century Studios was gonna get it Dolby back when they had it. There's 3 theaters really near me. Only 1 of them has this on sale as of now, though the other 2 theaters may come later? (May 26).)

**A Quiet Place: Day One**

- Flip (Has a fan event on the same day of previews, PLF only **(May 30)**.)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp *using TheFlatLannister's Dune2+GOTG3 comp*: $30.46M**

- AMC (""Some 200,000 movie fans have bought their AMC tickets already. This is more Day 1 ticket sales at AMC than for any other R-rated movie ever."" Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that first-day sales are likely around $8 million to $9 million if extrapolating the 200,000 stat cited by Aron (May 22).)

- DEADLINE (Already heating up eight weeks before its debut, having already collected some $8M in first day ticket sales. $8M is pretty remarkable for an R-rated movie two months before release. While there are no direct comps on Deadpool & Wolverine ticket sales in post-Covid history, its current cash bests the 24-hour advance ticket sales of The Batman ($6.5M), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($6M) and John Wick: Chapter 4 ($1.4M). The Batman and GOTG3 opened to respective 3-day weekends of $134M and $118.4M (May 22).)

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. Best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M THU. Pretty damn great day 2! (May 21).)

- AniNate (THU sales still largely biased towards primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not enough for people to take off work early. | Good lord already 80+ THU previews sold for Deadpool at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Extremely strong growth from OD for Thursday. We have a monster on our hands here people. Buuut. Let me temper the excitement somewhat. The Friday numbers are good, stronger than Inside Out 2 by a considerable margin. However Inside Out 2 is looking very backloaded. This is looking extremely presales heavy right now. | Much more than IO2‚Äôs 1,200 tickets for Friday. But here lies the problem. There is only 122 tickets separating Thursday and Friday for Deadpool and Wolverine, and for IO2, there is 500 tickets between the two days for that movie. This far out I‚Äôm not freaking out. I think the gap will increase. It just alarmed me a little. I still think it‚Äôs going to be massive though. Just a word of caution (May 28). Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! Already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $28.9M THU. Moving along well (May 27). Nearly 300 sales day vs ~260 by Black Panther & ~200 of GOTG3. Another brilliant day. Given the length of sales window, comps be falling off but they have remained steady for first 4 days (May 24). Looking at keysersoze123's MTC1 data: These are incredible (May 22). $40.22M THU (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $25.69M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $31.04M/$38.62M/$40.21M/$22.35M (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver THU: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- jeffthehat (Took my first look in Indiana yesterday. Won't do a full post because I missed like 20 shows. But the gist is it was at ~3600 tickets sold and ~400 shows. Just as a point of reference, here are the highest values for tickets sold I have in my database. Bob Marley Wed T-1 = 3309 tickets sold. Dune 2 Thu T-1 = 3041 tickets sold. Godzilla x Kong Thu T-1 = 2328 tickets sold. Thus, sales are already the highest I've tracked with two months to go **(May 29)**.)

- keysersoze123 (Previews was taken late yesterday and Friday data was just now. Still going quite strong. very impressive after huge OD (May 28). Still really strong 3 days later (May 25). 1st few days of PS is all about fanboys so T-x does not matter. By this FRI it will be in steady state mode. With this long a cycle that would be at very low levels. | Looking at FRI sales, its IM will be closer to Thor 4 than BP2. So we can do the projections based on how the previews will go. However Its really early. Let us wait until we have T-x comps. Probably will have to wait until July to get credible comps. | MTC2 early sales tend to be way weaker for all movies. The disparity for big movies is even higher.  | Nothing out of ordinary in day 2 pace for MTC1 (May 22). Obvious skew on previews (compared to FRI) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19). Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish (May 17).)

- Legion Again (Previews this early in summer are almost a THU opening, so Fri soemthing like +35-55% from Th is IM ~4.9-5.5. If we get some strong Fri sales when we‚Äôre close maybe I‚Äôll drag it up to 5.6 or something but it will be really really tough to beat that. Expecting an IM close to Thor 4.

- Porthos (Comp: $20.87M THU. $6.90M earned so far in Sacramento **(May 30)**. For long releases of MCU/SW Saga caliber, it usually takes about 6 to 8 days for the initial wave to stop. The Rise of Skywalker didn't really ""bottom out"" until D9 or so (T-51).  Then at T-21, more or less, it started up its acceleration again. Can see similar patterns for MCU long runners (May 24). MCU/SW films tend to have a bit longer of a slope-down on the decent of the ""u-curve"" so I think I'll keep posting ""Day x"" comps for at least a couple more days (May 23). Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M THU Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20). | No comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close is Captain Marvel (T-58) and only other Disney release is TROS (T-59).  Longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi (~70 days). Longest major release since Fast X's 99 days.  Probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 days. Length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat. It's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS MON opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($150M locked imo.  Don‚Äôt really see under $30M for previews and a 6x multi gets it to $180M OW. With GOTG 3 early reception I think $200M becomes a real discussion (May 22). $44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. Sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M THU GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THU COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane. Has almost 200 more showings than Inside Out 2.  Sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). Also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and it's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- Tinalera (Toronto having an especially good run on pre sales- overall sales looking healthy (May 27). For a movie this far out, yea presales are doing well in Vancouver and Calgary. Its hard as very few movies open this early, but its healthy when we are getting between 5-10 percent sales for a movie not due out for 2 months (May 24).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark presale sets for DP3... 3 screens and 15 showings each - the PLF is giving 1 of 2 PLF screens and the non-PLF is doing some 3d showings. Not the set that a normal ""big"" Marvel movie gets, but it seems my 2 locals have taken a ""put up or shut up"" strategy for almost all blockbusters lately. This IS equal or more than most everything lately (although Bad Boys 4 is getting 3 screens and 14 showings at my PLF, so...). But, compared to 2019 Marvel, or even 2021 or EVEN 2023 Marvel...this is a low set (May 19).)

- vafrow (Comp: $45.2M THU. 12% over two days is pretty strong once the rush passes. We're not at the bottom of the curve yet it seems (May 24). 8% growth at this stage is very positive. I expect another drop tomorrow, but I'm probably not going to touch this until the weekend at this stage. I'm comping high, and without a proper MCU comparison (Marvels doesn't count), it's hard to gauge, but I feel this is just doing really well here (May 22). 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards PLFs in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start. Definitely feels like we got a potential 25m previews/150m+ opener. Still don't buy 200m OW but am starting to see 30m previews/175m+ OW as a strong possibility. | On its first day has sold over 10x Furiosa T-6 here in SE Wisconsin. At North Shore, 70% of Shang-Chi‚Äôs and Venom 2‚Äôs T-2, 47% of Homecoming‚Äôs T-2, and 41.25% of Thor: Ragnar√∂k‚Äôs T-2 - just using DP&W‚Äôs T-66! | At half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-4 sales here in the past ten minutes in just two of the theaters PLF shows (May 20). 42 showings for previews across four SE Wisconsin theaters I track. ~20% more showings than IO2 and about the same amount of PLFs spread. Likely 3-4 screens a theater for THU previews, but has SuperScreen + 2 UltraScreen screens in Majestic Cinema. Seems to be a 3D push with North Shore having primetime showings in 3D UltraScreen (May 19).)

- ThatWaluigiDude (Inside Out 2 started it's pre-sales. First day sold 3.5x of what Little Mermaid sold on it's first day, even though Inside Out 2 started the pre-sales much, much sooner (May 30). Cinemark will be holding a discount, starting on the 27th, where tickets go down to R$12 and food combos go down in price too. Cinemark is currently the biggest chain in Brazil, though is not in every single city, obviously. It will go all the way until june 19th, excluding only fridays, saturdays and sundays and the next holiday on the 30th. It's a bit shocking because that means the release day of all movies for 4 weeks will be discounted on Cinemark, including possible previews of Inside Out 2 (May 27).)

Holywood will have Garfield which has reached $170k in pre-sales for its opening day. Its projected a $2.6M-$2.8M opening day on Saturday (May 29). Garfield which collects a solid $55k in pre-sales on its first day on sale. Not bad and better than a lot of the recent animation's at the same point (May 28).)

#**Childrens Day(June 1st)**

Childrens Day this year only has 3 relevant releases. Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony continues the long term tradition of a Doraemon movie on Childrens day. There's been one every year since 2017 except 2020 during Covid. It technicaly releases tomorrow on the 31st but i'm using Saturday as a comparison for all 3 movies because its the Childrens Day itself.

Garfield hits over $400k in pre-sales for its opening day. Really solid and opening day projections have shifted up to $3M+.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

Garfield has now also been confirmed to release on the 1st.

**1. Blade Runner 2049(2017):** The original Blade Runner isn't popular in the real world as it is among cinephiles and Filmbros on social media. They made a sequel on a budget of $185M, brought back Harrison Ford and it still bombed.

**2. Doctor Sleep(2019):** Stanley Kubrick is one of the ultimate cinephile,#FilmTwitter, FilmBro director. Average Joes either haven't watched his movies or don't care about them. They don't worship The Shining as FilmBros on the internet do. WB made a mid budget sequel and it flopped. $72M on a budget of $45M-$55M.

**3. Serenity(2005):** If Firefly was really popular in the real world, why didn't folks check out this sequel. It only made $40M on a budget of $39M.",62,21

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/young_woman_and_the_sea) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** Buoyed by Daisy Ridley's radiant star power and the remarkable trajectory of Gertrude Ederle's life story, *Young Woman and the Sea* is an old-fashioned sports movie that harkens back to the classics in the best way.

**Sample Reviews:**

Joachim R√∏nning‚Äôs classically glorious ‚ÄúYoung Woman and The Sea‚Äù is a defiantly big-screen biopic that both earns one‚Äôs genuine tears, and inspires everyone of all ages to dream a little bigger, go a little further. - Tomris Laffly, Variety

The overworked screenplay doesn't strip the film of all its merits -- there's plenty here in terms of uplift and inspiration for most audiences -- but it does make one wonder about a version of this project that embodied the fluidity Ederle felt. - Lovia Gyarkye, Hollywood Reporter

An old-fashioned Disney crowdpleaser par excellence. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap

A classically made and effectively stirring sports drama for everyone that feels right on the big screen. Families with young daughters should make this a special priority -- this is one of those empowering stories that (mostly) avoids cloying cliches. **3/4** \- Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press

Even as Nathanson‚Äôs script veers into trite territory, serving up and taking down its archetypal antagonists, Trudy‚Äôs rise against adversity inspires all the same. **2.5/4** \- Thomas Floyd, Washington Post

This is one of those movies that proves, when they‚Äôve got a mind to, they can still make them like they used to. - Glenn Kenny, New York Times

This may not be quite the movie that Ederle deserves, but it‚Äôs the one that we‚Äôve got, and it‚Äôs definitely a story worth telling. **2.5/4** \- Moira MacDonald, Seattle Times

Nestled safely in the remote past, however, the story of a battle that has long since been won (you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a living person who believes women should not be allowed to go swimming) offers an anodyne, Disneyfied take on feminism. **2/5** \- Charles Bramesco, Guardian

It would take a churl to object to the schmaltz, which is partly down to Ederle‚Äôs achievements, but also to R√∏nning, investing a workaday script with palpable care. **3/5** \- Danny Leigh, Financial Times

It may sound a little silly or slight to mention, but Disney‚Äôs Young Woman and the Sea is saved from the grim pedestrianism of the Hollywood biopic by a smile. It switches on, like a lightbulb in a dark basement, across the face of its star, Daisy Ridley. **3/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK)

It‚Äôs impossibly moving, and speaks of deeper yearnings, and collective human needs, and the kind of grandiose ideas that are not normally addressed by glossy Disney biopics. **4/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

Like Trudy Ederle swimming the English Channel, knowing where you‚Äôre going, in this case, isn‚Äôt as significant as the near-irresistible, awe-inspiring act of getting there. - Brian Lowry, CNN.com

It‚Äôs long and sometimes gets swept astray by currents of family drama and period detail, but Ridley‚Äôs plucky determination and can-do energy carries the whole thing along. The result is an old-fashioned inspirational pleasure. **3/5** \- Helen O'Hara, Empire Magazine

Whether it‚Äôs Amelia Warner‚Äôs excessive orchestral score or the familiar beats in Jeff Nathanson‚Äôs script, Young Woman And The Sea often feels too tidy, delivering its uplifting message without specificity or insight. - Tim Grierson, Screen International

The real Ederle accomplished so much, it‚Äôs hard to imagine cramming it all into one tidy feature. The one we‚Äôve got? It‚Äôs good enough, rousing enough, compelling enough. **B-** \- Kate Erbland, indieWire

The story of Trudy Ederle becoming the first woman to swim the English Channel is a throwback to formative Disney sports movies like 'Cool Runnings' and 'The Rookie.' **3/4** \- Emily Zemler, Observer

The film leaves no room for doubt about what Trudy Ederle will accomplish, and thus creates virtually no dramatic tension in her inevitable rise to the top ranks of women‚Äôs swimming. **1.5/4** \- Derek Smith, Slant Magazine

A biopic with all sharp edges removed, the kind of non-threatening, inspirational Disney movie that teachers screen for fidgety students on the last day of fourth grade. - Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict

It is old-fashioned in the best sense, a straightforward story of a woman of extraordinary spirit and ability overcoming obstacles to achieve her dream. **B+** \- Nell Minow, Movie Mom

**SYNOPSIS:**

Daisy Ridley stars as the accomplished swimmer who was born to immigrant parents in New York City in 1905. Through the steadfast support of her older sister and supportive trainers, she overcame adversity and the animosity of a patriarchal society to rise through the ranks of the Olympic swimming team and complete the staggering achievement ‚Äì a 21-mile trek from France to England.

**Critics Consensus:** As single-mindedly focused on mayhem as its demonic monster, *In a Violent Nature* serves up a deliciously disgusting feast for gore aficionados.

**Sample Reviews:**

Its stripped-down approach to a familiar gist has a distinctiveness that is impressive, and is sure to please fans who are always up for a new slasher film ‚Äî but wish most of them weren‚Äôt so interchangeable. - Dennis Harvey, Variety

\[In a Violent Nature\] isn't a reinvention of the form, but Nash shows that with a little ingenuity, everything that's old can feel new again. **B-** \- Adam Graham, Detroit News

You may be satisfied, you may not. But you won't be on the fence. **3.5/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

Chris Rush‚Äôs well-shot but exceedingly gruesome gorefest mashes up all the slasher-flick tropes for a bloody genre salute. - Randy Myers, San Jose Mercury News

In a Violent Nature is the most thrilling, terrifying, gross and often quite funny reworking of the slasher genre in ages. - Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail

Nash wants the viewer to engage with the pure terror of what‚Äôs going on just as much as he wants them to sit in the tedium of it. The result is a film as worthy as its predecessors - and one of the most unsettling examples of the genre I‚Äôve seen in years. - David Sims, The Atlantic

Told from its killer‚Äôs point of view (except when it‚Äôs not), this anemic but formally compelling genre exercise strips the whole madman in a mask routine down to its skeleton. **C** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

Think B√©la Tarr doing an unholy doc-fiction hybrid about Camp Crystal Lake. **3.5/4** \- Keith Uhlich, Slant Magazine

The grossest, most elaborate kill-scenes I've ever seen in my life all fit seamlessly, where in other films a similar hodgepodge could fall flat amidst the chaos. This feels classic and completely new all at once.  - Kelly McClure, Salon.com

A fascinating arthouse horror experiment that plays more like a minimalist slice-of-life feature with a grim, gory twist. **3.5/5** \- Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting

It is a gore-fest that is splendidly committed to the bit. - Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

The enigmatic resurrection, rampage, and retribution of an undead monster in a remote wilderness unleashes an iconic new killer after a locket is removed from a collapsed fire tower that entombed its rotting corpse.

These films tend to do around $1 billion WW (other than the first one). The budget is unlikely to be over $100 million, and it seems unlikely to me for marketing to be over $200 million. Therefore, after theater cuts, it would probably make around $200 million in raw profits.

Inside out 2 could have a budget of $150-$200 million and $100-$200 million in marketing based on regular Pixar numbers (we can assume similar figures for Moana 2, Disney films have similar budgets and marketing to Pixar stuff). This means, in order to make a profit of $200 million, these films would need to gross at bare minimum $900 million for these kinds of profits, and possibly as much as $1.2 billion.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

Garfield has now also been confirmed to release on the 1st.

But hypothetically, let‚Äôs say they do release on the same weekend. I just read a post on X asking why Disney would release Moana 2 on the same day as Wicked: Part One. 

The replies were mixed, with some people saying that hype for a Moana 2 sequel died out, while the hype for a Wicked sequel has been around for a couple of years now since its announcement. Others brought up the fact that Moana 2 was the most-streamed film on Disney+ last year with over 800 million views and if anyone should be scared, it should be Wicked.

Universal is currently marketing Wicked like crazy. We‚Äôve gotten two trailers so far and it‚Äôs been confirmed that Universal will be forming partnerships with numerous brands to promote the film. Not only that, but there will be promotional tie-ins during the Olympics. And that‚Äôs just what‚Äôs been announced. Universal seems keen on keeping that date. However, Disney also loves that Thanksgiving weekend date, so if any film moves, it‚Äôll probably be Wicked. 

But in your opinion, who would win the weekend?

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the two films for the week.

#**A Quiet Place: Day One**

The film is written and directed by Michael Sarnoski (*Pig*), based on a story he conceived with John Krasinski. It serves as a spin-off prequel and the third installment in the *A Quiet Place* film series. The film stars Lupita Nyong'o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Djimon Hounsou. The film is set before the first film, and follows a woman named Sam who must survive an invasion in New York City by bloodthirsty alien creatures with ultrasonic sound hearing.

#**Horizon: An American Saga ‚Äì Chapter 1**

The film is co-written, produced, and directed by Kevin Costner (*Dances with Wolves*, *The Postman* and *Open Range*). The film stars Costner, Sienna Miller, Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Jena Malone, Abbey Lee, Michael Rooker, Danny Huston, Luke Wilson, Isabelle Fuhrman, Jeff Fahey, Will Patton, Tatanka Means, Owen Crow Shoe, Ella Hunt, Jamie Campbell Bower and Thomas Haden Church. The first part in a planned four-part saga, the film is set in the American Civil War period depicting the expansion of the American west.

Now that you've met this week's new releases. Let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- *A Quiet Place* is one of the most lucrative franchises for Paramount. Despite opening in May 2021 under bad conditions, *Part II* made just $40 million less than the first part. One of the film's most praised scenes was its opening scene depicting the beginning of the alien invasion, and now the audience will have the chance to see it in a full movie on massive scale by moving the setting to New York City. The film can also take advantage of the weak horror slate and offer something that the audience wants to actually watch. And while John Krasinski is not back in the director's chair, Michael Sarnoski received high praise for *Pig*, so his presence is a fantastic choice to ensure there will be some good quality. 

- Among old generations, Kevin Costner remains one of the most recognizable stars, and the audience will probably be interested in seeing him return to the Western genre. After all, *Yellowstone* is the most watched scripted series in North America, so perhaps he could translate that popularity to the big screen. This could also be a good attraction for old audiences, who don't necessarily rush out to watch a film as soon as possible, so it can hold extremely well. 

#**CONS**

- Neither John Krasinski nor Emily Blunt nor the other characters return for *Day One*. Something that helped the franchise earn this high was the connection that the audience felt to their characters, so their absence may put an asterisk on how high it can go. Outside *Star Wars*, prequels aren't known for outgrossing their original films, although *Day One* has the advantage of having new characters, so we don't know who lives or dies (except for Hounsou). 

- As mentioned, this is the first part in a planned four-film *Horizon* saga, with *Chapter 2* releasing in August. That's a lot of commitment for the audience, realizing that they will watch incomplete films. That already asks the question: will they watch a film that has no closure, along with the three other sequels? It doesn't help that *Chapter 1* alone has a 181-minute runtime. But the biggest factor might be its own reception; it already premiered in Cannes and it has received poor reviews (33% on RT). 

And here's the past results.

Movie | Release Date | Distributor | Domestic Debut | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total
:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
*Young Woman and the Sea* | May 31 | Disney | $4,700,000 | $12,855,555 | $21,587,500

What are some wildcard predictions that you have that you are sticking to.

  
For me I think that Wicked does a lot better than a lot of you are expecting it to do. I know it has strong direct competition against it (Moana 2) but from all of the promotion I have seen so far it seems to have taken over the TikTok audience in a way not as strong as something like Barbie but something still big enough to showcase that it has a lot more awareness than one might suspect. I would continue to keep my eye on it.",145,70
boxoffice,t3_1d3ddv5,1716992441.0,/r/boxoffice/comments/1d3ddv5/the_great_theater_decoupling_from_box_office/,:domestic: Domestic,"The great theater decoupling from ""box office returns"" needs to happen","To save themselves, theaters need to decouple from Hollywood's release cycle. And just focus on showing movies that need a theatrical experience.

In short they need to build on their subscription plans and become more of a streaming service. Don't rely on Hollywood's traditional release cycle. Focus on a core audience of movie lovers that want the best cinematic experience.

My kids were too young prepandemic to see movies. Now post pandemic, we go a lot. And, TBH, 75% of the memorable experiences are from rerelease movies that really benefit from a theatrical experience. We use my Alamo Season pass and watch a movie like Fury Rd, Phantom Menace, Interstellar, Blade Runner 2049, etc.

These screenings will be at least 75% sold out, if not completely sold out.

Further, my kids and I are weird. They are interested in producing film. They are theater geeks. One just had a film festival at school where their content was shown. But there IS a group of similar geeks (even film summer camps!). They do have cinephile friends as interested in the theater as they are starting well produced Youtube content.

People going to theaters now are connoisseurs. Not the general public. Similar to the class of people that enjoy roller coasters. It's still a big chunk of the public. But a specific group. They'll show up for that unique new film with an interesting story. They'll show up for known movies that will show way better than any home theater. They get engaged in film festivals, podcasts, and similar content about film. In fact, now more than ever, I feel like this sort of film geekery has become popular.

Theater chains need to decouple from Hollywood's boom and bust cycle. And focus instead on reliable income from our now vast encyclopedia of movies and a core (and growing IMO!) audience of true cinema lovers.",22,19

On Facebook,  when a struggling indie theater asked customers for ideas, several requested older, cheaper family films. (No wonder, judging from comments here about the cost for a family of four). That reminded us of the five year rule that kids' comic books used long ago when reprinting stories. The publishers figured that every five years there was a new generation of kids for whom the stories would be new. Same principle could apply to movies? 

Another thought: Hollywood will HAVE  to go in this direction. If families can't afford to take their kids to movies that means the next generations will not get used to going to theaters. Not getting used to theaters as a regular entertainment option except for the really big movies or event films, would be a doom spiral for many theaters that can not survive on low attendance for all the other movies.

On another note, got spoiled by local indie theater's affordable prices. Then went to cinemark to see a movie and felt stunned by cost, over thirty bucks for 2 to see a movie. And that was for a standard format open caption film. The Premium formats cost even more. ",13,25

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle Average THU Comp: $0.91M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.00M THU comp. No movement, probs looking at around $1 Million previews (May 28). Not bad, not bad (May 27).)

- Flip (Looking at some theaters near me, Haikyu is outselling Spy x Family (May 20).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.81M THU comp.)

- Rorschach (These numbers seem pretty damn good. Will echo @abracadabra1998's $1 mil previews prediction (May 28).)

**In a Violent Nature**

- el sid (Had also only showtimes in 4 of the 7 theaters but already 123 sold tickets. So where it gets shows, it does fine. Loose comps, all counted on Monday of the release week for Thursday: Tarot (715k from previews) had 97 sold tickets in 5 theaters, The Invitation (775k from previews) had 96 in 7 theaters, Pearl (1.3M OD) had 102 sold tickets in 6 theaters and The Strangers: Chapter One (1.2M from previews) had 215 sold tickets in 6 theaters (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.57M EA+THU comp.)

- Rorschach ($0.91M THU+FRI comp. 

**Summer Camp**

- el sid (Has shows in 3 of my 7 theaters and had not more than 7 sold tickets. So so far completely under the radar. Comp: Book Club 2 (6.7M OW) had also on Monday for Thursday 25 sold tickets in 5 theaters (May 28).)

**Young Woman and the Sea**

- JonathanMB (I just checked showtimes near me, and in the entire Chicago suburbs it looks like it's only in 5-7 theaters for Friday. Also randomly enough it has a couple of showtimes today at 3pm at some random AMCs? Looks like they're 30-50% full (May 27).)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.47M/$5.34M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $2.61M THU. All these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18 so that'll go down. Feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find good comps (May 19). Numbers are from last THU, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- el sid (Counted yesterday for Thursday had 395 sold tickets with shows in 6 theaters (the small AMC Lakeline in Texas is still missing). 10 days left. Bad Boys for Life (6.36M from previews) had on Monday of the release week 915 sold tickets = 43% at the moment for Bad Boys 4 with 7 days left to come closer or maybe overtake. My guess is that BB4 could have 800-1000k tickets by next Monday, so it could be pretty much on par with BBfL. Similar to other reports here: BB4 does not have stellar presales and after several disappointments I shouldn't exaggerate but compared to the best comps it looks quite good for BB4 as you can see (May 28).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $5.34M EA+THU.)

- keysersoze123 (Presales are again not that much at this point. I think its not going to hit the heights of last movie (May 28). It should start to amp up sometime this week (May 27). This wont be fan driven. Even the last one initially trailed Dr Do little in presales but amped up big time close to release. | This will be a late bloomer. I am still expecting 50m+ OW (May 23).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $5.11M THU. Steady pace, no acceleration yet. Switch to G x K since that had super strong walkups ($6.12M THU comp) and Bad Boys 4 will likely replicate this (May 27). Comps ($4.11M) would mean $40M+ Opening Weekend (May 24). Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- TwoMisfits (Aging male-skewing franchises tend to get the biggest bump from this deal. Folks are on the fence but know what they are getting. Female skewing non-sequel ones tend to get zero help.  You need baseline interest to get people willing to pay anything, b/c these still are $5.  The other effect of the deal is that movies releasing around the $5 hits sometimes get hurt. | June TMobile $5 Atom movie. This could help it go huge, like last year's Spider-Verse (May 22).)

- vafrow (Comp: $2.7M THU. It's staying pretty flat (May 28). Zero sales day when all comps seemed to have done well. Not a great result. Note: This isn't a holiday weekend in Canada, so that doesn't explain the slow sales. Hopefully it's just an anomaly. This has been very steady to date (May 27). Ghostbusters and Apes both went up in comps, but I didn't have Hunger Games included, so it's brought the average down. Still, its growing at a steady pace (May 26). I still expect this to be more walk up friendly than the comps being used, and should see a gradual rise as the date gets closer (May 25). Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20). Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. Very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

- YM! (Like IO2 the pace for Bad Boys is small but mighty. EA is only available at Majestic much like Garfield. With EA, it‚Äôs a few tickets shy of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 but without them it‚Äôs only a bit over half. Either way both is really good. I think we‚Äôll continue to see the gap grow over the week but as of rn, I am thinking around $6-7m previews without EA solely on vibes to an OW north of $55m (May 25). Same thing as IO2 for Bad Boys (see May 23 IO2 comment), I expect this to not only skew more GA friendly and should bulk up ticket sales as we get closer to release. It‚Äôs almost at half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 which is a pretty great thing. Should easily outdo it by T-6 imho (May 23). Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

**The Watchers Average Thursday Comp: $1.00M**

- filmlover (Hasn't sold anything near me (May 26).)

- Flip (These are good numbers considering it‚Äôs only playing in 2/3 theaters I track (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.00M THU Comp.)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Fellowship of the Ring (269 tickets, 6 showtimes, 4 theaters) on Saturday, June 8, 2024 and Saturday, June 15, 2024 (21 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). The Two Towers (243 tickets, 4 theaters) Saturday, June 9, 2024 and Saturday, June 16, 2024 (22 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). Return of the King (281 tickets, 4 theaters) for Saturday, June 10, 2024 and Saturday, June 17, 2024 (16 tickets, 4 showings, 4 theaters). 852 tickets sold in total. 793 tickets sold for the first week. 59 tickets sold for the second week (May 28).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.63M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $3.98M THU. Good update, hopefully this keeps on rising (May 23). Not impressed at all so far here sadly (May 19). Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here (May 15).)

- AniNate (Finally a little movement here. 23 Thursday, 52 Fri-Sun (compared to 18 THU and 23 FRI-SUN on May 17) (May 22). Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 THU preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first THU at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Some growth for THU, not bad but I expect sales to increase steadily as we get closer to release day. The presales are good enough to not be a disaster like Garfield, but not big enough to guarantee a 100m opening. I still like what I‚Äôm seeing though. As my local theater has finally shown some signs of life with this film. 5 tickets sold. Way better than Garfield at the same point. | The numbers might not be completely accurate, but it‚Äôs looking extremely strong for Friday. 900 tickets for the five theaters I track. Maybe even 1,286 tickets if my numbers are accurate. That tells me this is not front loaded whatsoever. Or at the very least not preview heavy (May 27). Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the THU previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on THU for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder (Comp: $12.33M THU at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- Flip (Decided to add one more theater but there was good growth in both of the original two (May 27). Fan event on the 16th has 43 tickets sold from 2 showtimes (compared to 8 showtimes and 73 tickets sold for previews), so that might be depressing previews a bit.)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $6.37M THU. Early sales haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18). At 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (If you compare this to any animation movies seen recently including Minions, its doing very well.  | Really good this far out for sure (May 25). Chugging along at this point (May 19). Show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective, easily the biggest for any animated movie in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $8.96M THU.  I don't agree with the undertone of concern when it comes to ticket sales for IO2.  They seem perfectly fine to me, maybe even somewhat strong.  It just isn't selling like a frontloaded CBM/fan driven franchise (even when adjusting for animation). So I suppose it really comes down to how much we think this will still act like a traditional kids animation film when it comes to buying pattern, how much demand has been burnt off, and how many people are still going to buy tickets but see no particular need to buy them early. Which I suppose really can't be answered until we get close to the time when kids animation films typically accelerate.  But, I keep looking at the sales in Sacramento and not seeing much cause for concern. Yet, at any rate (May 25). Decided to add Nope ($12.62M) to the comp block.  Not because I think it's a particularly good one (the ATP differences alone are a major red flag), but more for pace considerations considering how similar horror and kids animation are when it comes to being backloaded.  The other consideration with Nope is that it was on sale for nearly two weeks longer, so it did have a small amount of extra time to pad some seats sold.  But maybe the errors (ATP vs length of pre-sale) will cancel each other out.  PROBABLY NOT!  But the pace at the very least should be interesting (May 25).  10.0% Matinee sales, 5.3% 3D sales and 42.2% PLF sales. (May 19). Strange pre-sale pattern. Was there some sort of promo that dropped today?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (May 16). I do not have good comps, especially for D1.  5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Will it be as backloaded as Elemental?  It's tough to sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days, so perhaps not.  But it does show how backloaded purely kids animation is. Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales. Of presales, 3.5% are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the SAT of release weekend (NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost OW slightly depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $8.52M THU Florida and $7.57M THU Orlando Comp.)Excellent pace this far out. Does feel like something big is around the corner (May 27). Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18). This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for THU (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for THU (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for THU at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base THU rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow (Comp: $5.6M THU. It's starting to grow (May 25). I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19). No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of PLFs, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the PLFs (May 15).)

- YM! (Did a bit of quick math in following some comparisons for IO2 using Keysersoze123's earlier MTC1 data out of boredom again and pace is pretty good, 6.74M average THU comp. The same caveats apply (IO2 should have higher ATP than the other animations due to skew somewhat older and having PLFs but having lower ATP than TLM as that skews older and likely has more of audience to buy upfront, and Wish being on Discount Tuesday muddies things up) but the important thing is that pace healthy and gainer ground against its comparisons. Feel like tracking is right on the money of 75-85m OW but could grow stronger if pace continues strong and reviews are strong (May 26). The pace is moving nicely as we have about two and a half weeks left. Think there‚Äôs potential for ticket count pace to grow strongly. I have no comparisons but it is at Garfield‚Äôs EA-less T-3 ticket sales. Going to probably not say much on preview predictions but my thoughts of an OW in between 75m-100m still stand. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out (May 25). Little has changed as IO2 keeps on trucking along. I do theorize at least from the 250 ticket selling Funko Event, it‚Äôs plausible families and fans went for that date instead of Thursday night previews. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out. At the very least, I like that it doubled its previous sales a week ago as it shows pace and outdid Garfield‚Äôs T-6 (May 23). Did some snooping around for the Funko Event as I was curious if perhaps families getting presales for the opening Saturday vs opening Thursday as those sales are kind of weak Thursday and uhm it‚Äôs at 250 tickets. Which is like 5 times Garfield‚Äôs EA showing of 50 tickets all at PLF prices despite normal theaters. Most of which at 9:30 AM with only one theater having it at 11:00 AM (May 22). Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M THU comp and $22.2M FRI comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True FRI although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the THU average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount TUES so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20). Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event. Pretty solid for what it is. Majestic is healthy and about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn (May 17). Only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14).)

**The Bikeriders**

- Pinacolada (Actually sold some around me. It does seem like Focus is giving it kind of a shitty release though. Small screens. Definitely no PLFs, which 20th Century Studios was gonna get it Dolby back when they had it. There's 3 theaters really near me. Only 1 of them has this on sale as of now, though the other 2 theaters may come later? (May 26).)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp *using TheFlatLannister's Dune2+GOTG3 comp*: $30.46M**

- AMC (""Some 200,000 movie fans have bought their AMC tickets already. This is more Day 1 ticket sales at AMC than for any other R-rated movie ever."" Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that first-day sales are likely around $8 million to $9 million if extrapolating the 200,000 stat cited by Aron (May 22).)

- DEADLINE (Already heating up eight weeks before its debut, having already collected some $8M in first day ticket sales. $8M is pretty remarkable for an R-rated movie two months before release. While there are no direct comps on Deadpool & Wolverine ticket sales in post-Covid history, its current cash bests the 24-hour advance ticket sales of The Batman ($6.5M), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($6M) and John Wick: Chapter 4 ($1.4M). The Batman and GOTG3 opened to respective 3-day weekends of $134M and $118.4M (May 22).)

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. Best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M THU. Pretty damn great day 2!(May 21).)

- AniNate (THU sales still largely biased towards primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not enough for people to take off work early. | Good lord already 80+ THU previews sold for Deadpool at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Extremely strong growth from OD for Thursday. We have a monster on our hands here people. Buuut. Let me temper the excitement somewhat. The Friday numbers are good, stronger than Inside Out 2 by a considerable margin. However Inside Out 2 is looking very backloaded. This is looking extremely presales heavy right now. | Much more than IO2‚Äôs 1,200 tickets for Friday. But here lies the problem. There is only 122 tickets separating Thursday and Friday for Deadpool and Wolverine, and for IO2, there is 500 tickets between the two days for that movie. This far out I‚Äôm not freaking out. I think the gap will increase. It just alarmed me a little. I still think it‚Äôs going to be massive though. Just a word of caution (May 28). Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! Already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $28.9M THU. Moving along well (May 27). Nearly 300 sales day vs ~260 by Black Panther & ~200 of GOTG3. Another brilliant day. Given the length of sales window, comps be falling off but they have remained steady for first 4 days (May 24). Looking at keysersoze123's MTC1 data: These are incredible (May 22). $40.22M THU (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $25.69M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $31.04M/$38.62M/$40.21M/$22.35M (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver THU: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- keysersoze123 (Previews was taken late yesterday and Friday data was just now. Still going quite strong. very impressive after huge OD (May 28). Still really strong 3 days later (May 25). 1st few days of PS is all about fanboys so T-x does not matter. By this FRI it will be in steady state mode. With this long a cycle that would be at very low levels. | Looking at FRI sales, its IM will be closer to Thor 4 than BP2. So we can do the projections based on how the previews will go. However Its really early. Let us wait until we have T-x comps. Probably will have to wait until July to get credible comps. | MTC2 early sales tend to be way weaker for all movies. The disparity for big movies is even higher.  | Nothing out of ordinary in day 2 pace for MTC1 (May 22). Obvious skew on previews (compared to FRI) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19). Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish.  I wonder where Deadpool 3 will land. Anything is fine as long as it does pull in a Marvels (May 17).)

- Legion Again (Previews this early in summer are almost a THU opening, so Fri soemthing like +35-55% from Th is IM ~4.9-5.5. If we get some strong Fri sales when we‚Äôre close maybe I‚Äôll drag it up to 5.6 or something but it will be really really tough to beat that. Expecting an IM close to Thor 4. Better reception (in avg case, just by regression to the mean) but bigger previews/more fanrush element, ~cancelling. | [T-65 Projection Matrix ($166M-$186M OW)](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/31569-the-box-office-buzz-tracking-and-pre-sale-thread/?do=findComment&comment=4680041) (May 22).)

- Porthos (Comp: $20.87M THU. $6.72M earned so far in Sacramento (May 28). For long releases of MCU/SW Saga caliber, it usually takes about 6 to 8 days for the initial wave to stop. The Rise of Skywalker didn't really ""bottom out"" until D9 or so (T-51).  Then at T-21, more or less, it started up its acceleration again. Can see similar patterns for MCU long runners (May 24). MCU/SW films tend to have a bit longer of a slope-down on the decent of the ""u-curve"" so I think I'll keep posting ""Day x"" comps for at least a couple more days (May 23). Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M THU Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20). | No comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close is Captain Marvel (T-58) and only other Disney release is TROS (T-59).  Longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi (~70 days). Longest major release since Fast X's 99 days.  Probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 days. Length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat. It's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS MON opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($150M locked imo.  Don‚Äôt really see under $30M for previews and a 6x multi gets it to $180M OW. With GOTG 3 early reception I think $200M becomes a real discussion (May 22). $44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. Sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M THU GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THU COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane. Has almost 200 more showings than Inside Out 2.  Sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). Also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and it's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- Tinalera (Toronto having an especially good run on pre sales- overall sales looking healthy (May 27). For a movie this far out, yea presales are doing well in Vancouver and Calgary. Its hard as very few movies open this early, but its healthy when we are getting between 5-10 percent sales for a movie not due out for 2 months (May 24).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark presale sets for DP3... 3 screens and 15 showings each - the PLF is giving 1 of 2 PLF screens and the non-PLF is doing some 3d showings. Not the set that a normal ""big"" Marvel movie gets, but it seems my 2 locals have taken a ""put up or shut up"" strategy for almost all blockbusters lately. This IS equal or more than most everything lately (although Bad Boys 4 is getting 3 screens and 14 showings at my PLF, so...). But, compared to 2019 Marvel, or even 2021 or EVEN 2023 Marvel...this is a low set (May 19).)

- vafrow (Comp: $45.2M THU. 12% over two days is pretty strong once the rush passes. We're not at the bottom of the curve yet it seems (May 24). 8% growth at this stage is very positive. I expect another drop tomorrow, but I'm probably not going to touch this until the weekend at this stage. I'm comping high, and without a proper MCU comparison (Marvels doesn't count), it's hard to gauge, but I feel this is just doing really well here (May 22). 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards PLFs in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start. Definitely feels like we got a potential 25m previews/150m+ opener. Still don't buy 200m OW but am starting to see 30m previews/175m+ OW as a strong possibility. | On its first day has sold over 10x Furiosa T-6 here in SE Wisconsin. At North Shore, 70% of Shang-Chi‚Äôs and Venom 2‚Äôs T-2, 47% of Homecoming‚Äôs T-2, and 41.25% of Thor: Ragnar√∂k‚Äôs T-2 - just using DP&W‚Äôs T-66! | At half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-4 sales here in the past ten minutes in just two of the theaters PLF shows (May 20). 42 showings for previews across four SE Wisconsin theaters I track. ~20% more showings than IO2 and about the same amount of PLFs spread. Likely 3-4 screens a theater for THU previews, but has SuperScreen + 2 UltraScreen screens in Majestic Cinema. Seems to be a 3D push with North Shore having primetime showings in 3D UltraScreen (May 19).)

Both hip-hop songs perfectly aligned with the rebellious and delinquent tone of the Deadpool franchise, and felt perfectly in line with the target audience of the film, which is primarily teenage/young adult boys who like rebellious, juvenile humour. Compare that to the trailer for Deadpool and Wolverine, which used Madonna‚Äôs ‚ÄúLike a Prayer.‚Äù It‚Äôs a fantastic song, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but a (primarily) slow pop song by Madonna doesn‚Äôt really feel in line with the target audience for either Deadpool or Wolverine, and even watching the trailer, the song just doesn‚Äôt set the same tone that the songs in the 1st Deadpool did. 

Another example is the marketing for Furiosa. Back in 2019, Disney did a great job attracting female audiences to Captain Marvel, and it resulted in [a 45% female audience](https://variety.com/2019/film/news/captain-marvel-box-office-opening-weekend-record-1203160002/amp/)‚Äù for the movie.

I was not the biggest fan of Fury Road but watched the trailer for this which I haven't been doing as much lately for anything. It didn't even take needing to see it to predict that audiences might be tired of this type of storyline. Netflix already had Damsel earlier this year. I just had a feeling that no matter how good this ended up being that audiences might roll their eyes at it because of years filled with these type of stories and people going not another one.

Love Anya Taylor Joy but Furiosa seems like something that just came out too late. Mad Max is a pretty niche IP as is and there are just too many options to see films like this now everywhere including streaming. Think these type of protagonists will be fine in horror where they have always worked but outside of it, this just looked too similar to other things that are available to watch elsewhere once you remove Mad Max from it.

Hollywood lost me last year. I used to look forward to going to the theaters every summer but not this year. Too many forgettable releases and bad theater experiences have made me only want to go for something I'm really interested in like Deadpool & Wolverine or Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice. I predicted this summer could look bad in the fall of last year and it's happening now.

Now, with the upcoming Jedi Academy Rey film that is about to start filming or already is, why does Hollywood think that is going to be any different? It's coming too late. TFA was the same time as Fury Road. Star Wars is not in the same place now as when TFA released. Yet it seems like Disney wants to throw this huge budget at it when that trilogy has a divisive opinion among audiences and fans to say the least. 

Could Disney or Lucasfilm look at the reaction to Furiosa and realize that things might be changing and this idea is not the best one going forward?

I feel bad for Furiosa. Out of films that are like this, it feels like one of the best ones but it's in a sea of many that were not well received and look the same on the posters as something like Damsel or Rebel Moon.

This is not intended to start a woke vs non woke argument. It's just the truth of what I saw from someone who used to go to all of these. I thought it looked fine but also thought Hollywood needs to do something new.

Where does the data come from? I‚Äôve noticed the media/trades never really cite a source when they mention tracking. Is there an algorithm aspect, based on clicks or social media buzz? Is it literally polling, and just extrapolated from a very small sample size? If anybody knows the ins and outs of box office tracking, please enlighten me.

Just when you thought the box office couldn't get any worse.

&#x200B;

***Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga*** was the first film in the franchise to open at #1, yet its numbers were far below the most pessimistic predictions. ***The Garfield Movie*** opened solidly, although it didn't show signs of a break-out here. Angel Studios also released ***Sight***, which was off to a very weak start as well. 

&#x200B;

The Top 10 earned a combined $97 million ($123.7 million four-day). That's off a massive 39% drop from last year, when ***The Little Mermaid*** opened to almost $100 million. In fact, discarding 2020 and 2021 for the pandemic, it was the worst Memorial Day weekend in at least 20 years, and the first one to miss $100 million. And that's not even adjusted for inflation. 

&#x200B;

Debuting in 3,804 theaters, ***Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga*** flopped with just $26.3 million ($32.3 million four-day). That's a rough 43% drop from ***Mad Max: Fury Road***, which debuted with $45.4 million back in May 2015. And that's despite nine years of inflation, which makes it even worse. Another sad stat: adjusted for inflation, the debut is barely above ***Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome*** ($21.2 million adjusted).

&#x200B;

The last time we had a worse #1 during Memorial Day was ***Casper*** back in 1995. Adjusted for inflation, it was the worst in over four decades. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, despite the pretty great reviews, the film had a lot against it.

&#x200B;

No one will deny that ***Fury Road*** is one of the most acclaimed action films of the century, perhaps of all time. But that film, despite making $380 million worldwide, was still a money loser due to its high budget. The figures vary, with *The Hollywood Reporter* reporting that the film lost $20-$40 million for Warner Bros. Now, despite not being a success, the acclaim allowed it to snatch 6 Oscar wins, and nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. So while WB may have expected more, they got the incentive to continue with the franchise. $380 million is still a lot of money for an R-rated film like this. 

&#x200B;

But instead of striking while the iron is hot, Warner Bros. got into a severe lawsuit with director George Miller in 2017, as the latter claimed he did not receive a disputed $7 million bonus. This caused production on ***Furiosa*** and a ***Fury Road*** sequel to stall. The lawsuit was settled in 2020, after which Miller started pre-production on this film. But that's the thing; 9 years is way too long for a follow-up and audiences eventually lose interest. The preferential gap between franchise follow-ups should be as close as possible. Had it come out in 2018 or 2019, it would've fared far better. 

&#x200B;

But that also leads to another problem; was a Furiosa prequel the film that the audiences wanted to watch after ***Fury Road***? We cannot make assumptions, but it's tough to say the audiences didn't want to watch Mad Max on another epic adventure after the events of the film. After all, the franchise is called ***Mad Max***. Prequels limit the potential audience of the film; this film does not feature Mad Max save for a brief cameo (and it isn't even played by Tom Hardy). So if the audience feels the prequel won't add anything, they simply won't watch it. That's a disadvantage of prequels; you know Furiosa, Immortan Joe and his men will all live. Outside ***Star Wars*** (and even that's because of inflation), prequels aren't known for improving on their previous films.

&#x200B;

The absence of Hardy and Charlize Theron also hurt the film. It's ridiculous to expect Theron to play a younger version of the character, but the character is linked to Theron, no matter how great ***Furiosa*** ends up. Hardy and Theron are not box office draws, but they have a lot of success to their names. In contrast, Anya Taylor-Joy may be popular online, but she has starred in a lot of bombs in the past few years and does not have a single film as leading lady above $75 million. And Hemsworth, while obviously popular for Thor, has not been able to translate that popularity at the box office; he hasn't had a single box office hit since ***Snow White and the Huntsman*** in 2012. So you've got two actors that despite being ""popular"", aren't exactly ""popular"" enough to help a film. 

&#x200B;

Now, perhaps the biggest factor, is that the ***Mad Max*** franchise simply has not been huge. Yeah, ***Fury Road*** made $380 million but that showed that the franchise has a ceilling. When it debuted in 1979, ***Mad Max*** earned $100 million worldwide, albeit with an almost non-existent presence in North America. ***The Road Warrior*** made $36 million in rentals, while ***Beyond Thunderdome*** made $52 million in rentals. Good for their times, but not strong enough for a $168 million film like ***Furiosa***.

&#x200B;

According to Warner Bros., a colossal 93% of the audience was 18 and over, and 55% was in the 18-34 demographic. Only 2% of the audience was 13-17, and 9% was 55 and over. Despite Furiosa as the lead, only 28% of the audience was female, although that's not exactly surprising. 

&#x200B;

The film received a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is the same score as ***Fury Road***. That's not a horrible score, but it does not indicate the general audience will discover the film in subsequent weekends. That film had great legs, but ***Furiosa*** doesn't have the same amount of acclaim. Whatever the case, a sub $100 million run is imminent. Miller was hoping to get to ***The Wasteland*** with Hardy, but those plans might die unless there's a miracle. But one thing is certain: ***Furiosa*** won't ride the highways of Valhalla and McFeast with the heroes of all time.

&#x200B;

Sony's ***The Garfield Movie*** debuted with $24 million ($31.2 million four-day) in 4,035 theaters. That's barely above what Bill Murray's reviled live-action/animation hybrid earned back in 2004. At least, it already surpassed the lifetime of the sequel ($28 million). 

&#x200B;

Considering it cost just $60 million, this is a solid debut that puts it in profitability territory. But one can't help but feel like the film could've made even more. After all, it's the first animated title in 2 months. It even managed to open below last week's ***IF***, and that's despite having the IP advantage on its side. 

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, ***Garfield*** is a well known but not massively popular film franchise. It didn't help that Murray's films were poorly received, so it looks like there isn't a lot of market for these films. Sony tried to market the film as a funny adventure for the whole family, but the marketing simply lacked a ""hook"". There's nothing fresh about this film, and it doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before. If you watched the trailer, you already saw the whole film. In fact, one of the biggest complaints heard is that the film has very little resemblance to the character. Animated films are often critic-proof, but even the reviews for ***Garfield*** were quite bad (38% on RT). 

&#x200B;

According to Sony, 53% of the audience was female and 44% are over 24 years old. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is a very poor grade for a family film (these films end up in the A range most of the time). Even ***IF*** still got an A. It's tough to determine how much it will gross, but it's a conclusion that families are prioritizing ***IF*** and ***Inside Out 2*** for their kids. It should pass Murray's original, but $100 million remains a question mark. 

&#x200B;

In third place, ***IF*** dropped 52% and added $16.1 million ($22.2 million four-day). Considering it was facing ***Garfield***, that's not a bad drop. Through Monday, the film has earned $64.8 million, and there's a strong chance it will finish with over $100 million domestically. 

&#x200B;

***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*** eased 47% and grossed $13.3 million ($17.5 million four-day). These aren't fantastic holds, but the film has held far better than its ""B"" on CinemaScore suggests. The gap between this and ***War*** continues expanding; it's now $7 million ahead of that film through the same point. It has made $127 million domestically, and it should earn over $160 million.

&#x200B;

In fifth place, ***The Fall Guy*** eased just 28% and added $5.9 million ($7.8 million four-day). That takes its domestic total to a meager $72.2 million, and it looks like a sub $90 million run is becoming more likely. 

&#x200B;

***The Strangers: Chapter 1*** dropped 53%, earning $5.5 million ($7 million four-day). Through Monday, the film has earned $22.7 million. 

&#x200B;

In seventh place, we had another newcomer, Angel Studios' ***Sight***, but the film bombed with just $2.7 million ($3.7 million four-day) in 2,100 theaters. Even with an ""A"" on CinemaScore, it's unlikely the film makes a good impression in the coming weeks.

&#x200B;

***Challengers*** dropped 51% and added $1.4 million ($1.8 million four-day). That takes its domestic total to $46.5 million. 

&#x200B;

Unsurprisingly, ***Back to Black*** collapsed 62% for a $1 million weekend ($1.3 million four-day). That was imminent, given that the film had no appeal beyond Amy Winehouse's fans. And even those fans are disliking the film. The film has earned just $5.3 million, and it will finish below $7 million domestically. 

&#x200B;

Rounding up the Top 10 was Neon's expansion of Pamela Adlon's ***Babes*** into 590 theaters. But the film amassed just $1 million ($1.2 million four-day). In contrast, ***Bottoms*** made $3 million in 125 more theaters. Expect it to finish below $5 million. 

&#x200B;

As a bonus: Sony re-released ***Spider-Man: Far From Home*** on Monday, but it earned just $265,000. That's even less than ***Homecoming***'s re-release ($285K). 

#**OVERSEAS**

***Furiosa*** also led the overseas box office, yet it was also a very weak start. Originally projected to debut with $80 million, it earned just $64.8 million worldwide. For comparison, ***Fury Road*** debuted with $109 million worldwide back in 2015. The best debuts were in Korea ($6.4M), France ($2.6M), the UK ($2.5M), Mexico ($2.4M), and Australia ($2.2M). With a debut this weak, a sub $200 million is becoming a possibility. 

&#x200B;

***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*** added $20.6 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to near $300 million after 3 weeks. Its best markets are China ($25.3M), France ($17.3M), Mexico ($15.5M), UK ($13M) and Brazil ($7.6M).

&#x200B;

***The Garfield Movie*** added $14 million, and its cume is now $97.5 million. It had solid starts in the UK ($2.5M) and Middle East ($1M). It still has Indonesia, Australia, Poland, France and Japan left.

&#x200B;

***IF*** crossed $100 million worldwide after adding $11.3 million overseas. Its best markets are France ($6.8M), Mexico ($5.5M), UK ($5.4M), Australia ($3.4M) and Germany ($2.4M).

&#x200B;

After struggling, ***Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire*** has finally crossed $200 million worldwide. A good milestone, but the film is still not a hit with that $100 million budget. 

#**MOVIES THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

None. 

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The year-to-year comparisons are about to get worse. We might have a weekend without a single film above $15 million. 

&#x200B;

Disney is returning with their first film of the year, ***Young Woman and the Sea***. It stars Daisy Ridley as Gertrude Ederle, an American competitive swimmer who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. Even with Disney's backing, don't expect much; it's only getting a limited theatrical release. By how much? We don't know, but certainly not strong enough to make $10 million this weekend. 

&#x200B;

North America is also getting ***Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle***. The film already opened in Japan, where it has made $68 million so far. How much will it make compared to ***Spy x Family*** ($4.8 million)?

&#x200B;

Another release is Roadside Attractions' ***Summer Camp***, starring Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodard. Don't expect much here; Roadside is not known for pulling great numbers.

#**ANNOUNCEMENT**

No write-up next week, just the image. Real-life stuff, but it's not like we're getting an exciting weekend here. We'll return for ***Bad Boys: Ride or Die***.",24,73

And that not every film that flops or does 'just okay' is automatically a terrible film?,"It seems to me that this subreddit loves film. So maybe on some level, seeing it limp quite a bit post-2020 hurts a bit and we're all just in denial that the pandemic forever altered how audiences engage with film and are now more choosy what to go out of their way for a theater experience?

Then again, I'm not the only one that notices many here seem to root for failure and relish when a film does poorly, but who knows.

But overall, it seems as if some are in steep denial that film, as a medium, is very much losing its footing in relevance and/or the way Joe Public engages with it has altered severely.

And that the fault of poor box office returns in the last few years lies solely on ""*Hollywood make bad moviezz*!!!!""

It isn't that simple, people. A swath of perfect 10 films aren't going to suddenly swoop in to save the day and get audiences back into theaters on the regular. It ain't happening.

It just gets me eye-rolling when a film tanks, underperforms or barely breaks even - and many here seem to laugh and say it must be a bad film (despite good critic/audience scores). I had that all last year thrown at me with films that I loved that didn't do well - I kept getting told ""*if it was any good, it wouldn't have flopped! LOL!*"" 

Though what cracks me up is that suddenly, the same people are changing their tune after *Furiosa*. That film bombing doesn't mean it's a bad film, of course! It only proves that when it's a film they don't like. How convenient.

Still, where's the parade of people saying *Furiosa* must be a bad film since it flopped?

But why is it so insane to suggest that maybe film - much like the music industry - is going to be dictated going forward by a select few heavy-hitters that make a killing and everyone else does pretty okay, at best?

We are witnessing a transitionary period that will alter film forever. 

People can say ""*BUT Dune Part II did well!*"" - but that's what people mean when they say event films like *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* are the ones that do well.  *Dune* was one of those.

Heck, even *Dune* would've made more in 2019 than it did this year.

Things have changed. It's not because movies suddenly are worse than ever (does anyone here even remember the 2000s with regular awful rom-coms and the '\_\_\_\_\_ Movie' marathon??). 

It's cost of tickets, it's inflation, it's the inevitable result of streaming, and it's the result of film not being as important as it used to be.",291,503

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

#Childrens Day(June 1st)

Childrens Day this year only has 3 relevant relesese. Doraemon the Movie: Nobita's Earth Symphony continues the long term tradition of a Doraemon movie on Childrens day. There's been one every year since 2017 except 2020 during Covid.

Holywood will have Garfield which collects a solid $55k in pre-sales on its first day on sale. Not bad and better than a lot of the recent animation's at the same point.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

Garfield has now also been confirmed to release on the 1st.

No-one can quite decide if it was a success or not; it almost tripled its $100m-odd budget, and garnered the best reviews WDAS had had in years, but Disney were clearly expecting more. Naturally, applying the 2.5x rule, it did make a profit, but only just: somewhere in the region of $20m would have been returned to Disney. Hardly the landslide victory that the grand return to fairytale storytelling suggested.

A few factors have been singled out as possible causes. The title having the word 'princess' in it affected its four-quadrant appeal, as did the 2D animation style, which Lasseter performed market research on after the fact and found that the film was perceived as being 'old fashioned.' (How short-sighted in retrospect; the film is gorgeous). Then there's the fact that only one week after it opened, Avatar debuted and mopped the floor with literally all competition for weeks on end ‚Äì so the fact the film even made it to just shy of $300m *at all* is a miracle.

In the years since, however, this middling financial response has not prevented the film from sticking around in the Disney stable. Tiana's face is still plastered all over merch, she's a regular in the Princess lineup, and a big-budget Splash Mountain retheme pertaining to the movie is taking place as I type. You'll frequently see little girls around the parks rocking that green lilypad dress. Likewise, the songs have entered the book of Disney classics, and it's cultivated a following that films such as Wish are unlikely to do.

Can this legacy be purely attributed to the film's quality, or something else? Has time just been extra kind to it? And most importantly, in better market conditions and with a different title, would the movie have earned more dough? Let's discuss.",67,186

Yet is going to theater for first time in decades to see ASL 'Jesus' film. ,"Yesterday, hosted friend for memorial day. While we were chatting, asked friend if he was going to see the deaf ASL 'Jesus' film. Friend said, yes, because he goes to a megachurch that has ASL interpreters. Then friend says he hasn't been to a theater for decades - despite the availability of both closed caption devices and open caption screenings. Is our friend an anomaly, or are there others like him, deaf non-theater goers who are being drawn back to the theater by this film because it is religious? While checking presales for this film nationwide, have found some locations are selling zero tickets, while others are selling extremely well - one is almost sold out (currently 89% sold), and it looks like some had to add additional screenings when they saw the presales. One even has three screenings on the same evening.

Will our friend have a good enough experience at the theater for the first time in decades to be able to decide if he will return for regular movies? Will he feel the cost of a ticket is too much to justify returning? Will he be turned off by high prices for concessions? Will he refuse to return to that theater because the theater offering the ASL film does not have regular open caption screenings? So many questions. What would it take to turn people like our friend from non-theater goers into theater-goers? Would it take more 'event' movies - not necessarily religious ones, but more unique, event-type films? Someone in another post wondered how many non-theater goers returned to theaters after Barbenheimer. How many non-theater goers drawn by Taylor Swift's 'Eras Tour' have returned to theaters since?

It is too early but if there is any interest, can share some attendance data later for this ASL 'Jesus' film after it is shown June 20 and June 23. Collecting screenshots and will be doing a Facebook album or Reddit screenshot collection on own sub afterwards.",14,0

The deal, as it is currently understood, is that if no new Lego movies materialize under the Universal banner by 2025, the rights will revert to WB. What is the likelihood of this occurring, do we think? Producer Dan Lin has repeatedly suggested a third Lego film is in development, but it seems unlikely now that (even if it exists, which some speculate he's bluffing about) it'll meet the deadline.

Assuming WB gets the rights back, would they even want to pursue a Lego Movie 3? Or perhaps some smaller projects like a TV series? The Lego Movie (specifically the first one) is still viewed very fondly, and kids who grew up with it have hit the sweet spot of nostalgic potential.

Lego Movie 2 had the unfortunate burden of being in a lose-lose time window; too long since the first film to maintain its momentum, but not long enough that kids who saw the original would be nostalgic (if anything, they'd be teens just like the kid in the movie, feeling 'too cool' for Lego, which shot the movie right in the foot!). Any threequel would not have this issue.

As we head into peak summer box office season, we are looking to add 1 or 2 new moderators to the /r/boxoffice team. This sub continues to grow at a rapid pace, and summer season brings a lot of attention (sometimes negative) to the box office. These past few weeks have seen an alarming growth in activity, and the mod team could use more help.

Our goal is always to keep this sub about the numbers as much possible, and keep the arguments/flaming/trolling to a minimum. If you've been an active member of this community would like to help with moderation:

Comment on this post if you are interested, please tell us why you'd like to join the mod team, and give us general feedback about the subreddit and/or tell us something you dislike about the sub that you'd like to help fix/improve. We will consider everyone that comments, and don't take it the wrong way if you aren't chosen. We probably will be adding even more mods in the near-future so your application could be considered again then.

General requirements:

* A decent amount of activity in the sub in the past **12 months at least.** 
* No previous bans/mutes from this subreddit.
* A general positive attitude in the sub (ie: no history of arguing, flaming, trolling, baiting, etc)
* An actual interest in the business side of movies/box office. 
* Previous moderation experience is not mandatory, but it helps, same with CSS/formatting knowledge and all of that.

Mod job description: 

* Remove shitposts/spam/memes/off-topic stuff/throwaway accounts/trolls/duplicate news/etc.
* Keep arguments/flamewars/negativity/rudeness/etc to a minimum.
* Ban unruly/rude/bad-faith users.
* Helping to approve new, legitimate users. 
* Get yelled at and called names in modmail.
* The privilege to get movies ruined by spoilers before most others.

We will choose 1 or 2 new mods by June 15th.",30,65

The Tom Cruise movie is the obvious starting point. But Cruise ain't making legal thrillers, in 2024 - or at least he ain't *making bank* making legal thrillers

---------------------------------------------

Same goes for the Clint, the Julia, the Sly and the Ford - their star power (and the stardom of their modern day equivalents) is *meaningless* in 2024

-----------------------------------------------

The comedies? **Nobody**'s making comedies in 2024

The sexy drama? *Challengers* (another movie about a three-way) is sitting on 1.5x

An action movie reboot of an old TV show? *Fall Guy* just tanked, sucker!

-----------------------------------------------

Maybe one of the smaller movies would sneak through to become one of those weird successes nobody can explain, like *Anyone But You*  
  
Maybe *Schindler* would be the equivalent of *Oppenheimer* - WWII biopic that succeeds on the strength of its star name director

Maybe *Tombstone* would do as well as *Horizon (Part One)*

--------------------------------------------------

But mostly, the films on this list would flop worse than *Heaven's Gate*, today

The difference between 1993 and 2024 is that **every** movie has to be *Jurassic Park* (heavy on VFX, action and large-scale visual spectacle) just to avoid sinking into oblivion 

All the execs behind these movies had to do was say they had Ford or Roberts attached and audiences were literally queuing around the block to throw money at them

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people (a lot) comment that Marvel /Disney/ Warner are crazy to give some of their bigggest blockbusters 200M+ budgets, when in reality, they‚Äôve been doing it for decades. Inflation is just making the budget‚Äôs nominal number bigger, but it‚Äôs not a new thing for studios to spend that kind of money on a movie. 

Here are the 2004 (20 years ago) movie budgets adjusted for inflation to 2023 values, listed from most expensive to least expensive:

1. **Spider-Man 2**
   - Original Budget: $200 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $300 million

2. **Troy**
   - Original Budget: $175 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $262 million

3. **The Polar Express**
   - Original Budget: $165 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $247 million

4. **Van Helsing**
   - Original Budget: $160 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $239 million

5. **Alexander**
   - Original Budget: $155 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $232 million

6. **Shrek 2**
   - Original Budget: $150 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $224 million

7. **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**
   - Original Budget: $130 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $194 million

8. **The Day After Tomorrow**
   - Original Budget: $125 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $187 million

9. **I, Robot**
   - Original Budget: $120 million
   - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $179 million

10. **Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events**
    - Original Budget: $140 million
    - Adjusted for Inflation (2023): Approximately $209 million

I understand that they used to be a lot more careful about which movies they gave big budgets too, but we also have to acknowledge that there‚Äôs always been misses regarding budget and profit. 

Nowadays we‚Äôre seeing inflated budgets because of the strikes and the pandemic, but there‚Äôs still a lot of reasonably budgeted movies that just look expensive due to inflation. ",74,217

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Civil War and Furiosa on June 7th, IF on June 15th, Inside Out 2 on June 21st and Despicable Me 4 on July 12th

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! The Movie will also release at some point.


---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

Garfield has now also been confirmed to release on the 1st.

Any suggestions?","The idea was to draft a ""team"" of 8 or so actors and actresses under 35 that we are investing in for the future. They get a big hit, it's a win, same with critical acclaim and awards. 

I'm familiar with the Ringer rankings but we're looking for some sort of system we can develop to track winners.

  
In my mind, the importance of ranking is:

* Box office success
* Critical success (perhaps Metacritic score)
* Accolades
* Nominations
* General ""popularity"" (IG following perhaps, maybe Met Gala visits)

  
Anything else we should consider or any thoughts on how to measure this up?",14,3

Universal seems very set on keeping that *Jurassic World 4* release date, I don‚Äôt see it being delayed. Even if it isn‚Äôt on the July 4th weekend it should still be out next summer.

*Superman* currently appears to be staying on track to open July 11, 2025 as it‚Äôs the furthest along in production at this time. Unless Warner Bros. becomes afraid of the competition, I believe *Superman* will stay in July 2025.

Now, *The Fantastic Four* appears to be the most likely candidate for a delay. While most of the cast has been revealed, production does not begin until August. And with Kevin Feige‚Äôs comments on Marvel Studios intending to slow down on content, I think it will be pushed back. I believe this will be delayed from July 25 to November 7, thus pushing *Blade* into 2026.

Ever since Furiosa bombed, so many Twitter Pundits have given their hot takes as to why.

Film executives also live in these bubbled, elite cities and don‚Äôt really know what going to the movie theater is like for 85% of the nation. 

I am a movie fan who lives in the South. It is *rough*. Premium screens are few and far between. Prices are still high, but the local economy is so shit that no one can afford it. Movies come into and exit theaters way too fast. If you want to see a blockbuster on a premium screen, you have to see it opening weekend. 

For those whose lives aren‚Äôt centered on the industry, going to the movie theaters is a laborious affair. I have to get on the highway to go to my local theater, which isn‚Äôt something I want to do every week in the dark. Executives do not test their own product.

The Dumpster Battle is released this week on Friday. After being a huge success in Japan and getting Southeast Asian release dates, the movie of the beloved sports anime is finally arriving in domestic markets.

I actually saw the film yesterday with my family. I can't really speak of the quality of the film as I'm someone who only barely knows what Haikyuu! is outside of the general premise (if you check my Letterboxd, I didn't even grade it). But I will say as an outsider I was able to follow it alright and my sister who actually is a huge fan cried so it's clearly doing something right for the ones. 

I'm curious how y'all think this will do tihs upcoming weekend. The First Slam Dunk movie got it's U.S. last July and it wasn't a huge smash **HOWEVER**, to be fair to the film it was released a week after Barbenheimer debuted. This weekend though we do not have any big releases save for the inspirational drama Ezra and the new comedy Summer Camp. We've seen recently like the intro arc to the newest Demon Slayer nearly top the box office. And while Demon Slayer is a far more popular anime, Haikyuu! is no small fish. Could we see this film make a play for the Top 5 or even Top 3?",8,6

When actors who aren‚Äôt action stars take the gamble on being an action stars and it works for them. I‚Äôm thinking specifically of Nicolas Cage in 96-97 after winning the Oscar for Leaving Las Vegas.

Of course, we‚Äôve just seen an example of it not paying off with Dev Patel. I was talking with a friend about why it would pay off for one actor and not another. This friend is more knowledgeable about box office, I‚Äôm more of a novice who knows bits and pieces.

His conclusion was that Patel jumped the gun and tried going 0-60. In contrast Cage did two things.

1. While both Patel and Cage are decent actors, Cage had put in more years in dramas, romcoms etc and was more known as a box office presence. If Patel wants to make a serious go of it, he needs to venture past the arthouse (where people like him, Oscar nominated, working with Wes Anderson etc.) and try to maybe be in a franchise film or two or some studio films. I read he‚Äôs rumoured to be eyed for Jurassic World‚Äôs new lead and that sounds like exactly what he needs to focus on for 5-10 years before he puts himself forth as solo action lead again.

2. During the 96-97 run, Cage was either co-lead with or supported by established star talent (Travolta, Connery, Malkovich, Cusack). Again Jurassic World or something similar may help here. Monkey Man banked entirely on Patel‚Äôs shoulders where he may have been smarter to take a secondary lead for his first action movie with an established star and sat on Monkey Man for 5 years etc. 

Or maybe Patel is more suited to the Wes Anderson arthouse where he‚Äôs found success rather than trying to turn himself into a star.

As I say, I‚Äôm not an expert so I can‚Äôt say if my friend‚Äôs analysis is correct, but to my non expert ears it makes sense. The extent of my knowledge is checking box office mojo once a week or so. ",17,6

The deaf and hard of hearing community has been heavily promoting this film on Facebook and other social media, and the results can be seen in the advance sales. Some of the theaters showing this film don't even have regular open caption screenings. They ought to pay attention to the sales numbers here because that's a strong indicator of the kind of business they could be doing if they offered and promoted open captions. For example, the Cinemark Colonel Glenn in Little Rock, Arkansas does not offer regular open caption screenings; but look how many seats they have already sold for the Jesus film!

Edit: The film has a website, [https://www.jesusdeaffilm.com/](https://www.jesusdeaffilm.com/), with a trailer and search tool for finding a theater.

In the case of Superman, they started shooting in late February, James stated that they will finish production in July and that he advances the film shot to the VFX as he films so they can have more time, they will have a whole year for post production.

boxoffice,t3_1d1d66k,1716763221.0,/r/boxoffice/comments/1d1d66k/do_you_think_short_vod_windows_are_partially/,Release Window,Do you think short VOD windows are partially responsible of these current trend of box office bombs?,"I know the usual arguments pro-short VOD windows:

- Most movies make 90% of their box office during the first 2/3 weeks.
- If a movie tanks on cinemas, might as well try to squeeze some money from VOD while all the marketing is still fresh in the audience‚Äôs minds.
- VOD consumers are a very specific niche and most people won‚Äôt pay 20 bucks to rent a film. It‚Äôll still be a while until the movie is free on streamers.

All of that might be true. I don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúThe Fall Guy‚Äù would be making a ton of money today on theaters if it wasn‚Äôt available on VOD. 

But to me the big issue is one of perception. You are training the audience to just wait until a movie is available at home. Even if you aren‚Äôt paying for the VOD, the fact that a friend or coworker is telling you that he saw ‚ÄúThe Fall Guy‚Äù last night at home, that signals that it‚Äôs already on home media.

So next time you‚Äôre considering to go to the theaters you‚Äôll probably be ‚Äúnah, I‚Äôll just catch it in a few weeks on my TV‚Äù. 

If you wanna save theaters, there‚Äôs gotta be a much higher buffer between the premiere and the home media release. You must watch it on cinemas or else you‚Äôll miss out on the experience for a long long time.


EDIT: Funny how half the people here go ‚Äúyeah, you‚Äôre stating the obvious, Sherlock‚Äù and the other half is ‚Äúthat‚Äôs dumb, VOD has nothing to do with theater box office‚Äù.",145,83

#**Weekend Box Office (May 24th-26th)**

The Last Frenzy keeps the lead on a pretty dead weeeknd only slipping -15% from last week. 

Twilight jumps back to 2nd also only easing -17%.

Planet of the Apes doesn't have as much luck but manages to get a sub 50% drop.

And as if things couldn't get worse for Holywood after The Fall Guy oppened to $0.71M last week this week sees an even bigger flop with The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare opening with just half a million.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Civil War and Furiosa on June 7th, IF on June 15th, Inside Out 2 on June 21st and Despicable Me 4 on July 12th

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! The Movie will also release at some point.


---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

I think that no matter how well Mufasa does it could still eat up a portion of Sonic 3s audience. I think moving it up a week could give Sonic a very big advantage in the theatrical marketplace while also giving it juicy holiday legs. The current schedule on that date is not very strong with Kraven and War of the Rohhirim (25m+ max openings) Sonic 3 should easily top this bunch of films and make really good money overall with all of the hype it has with fans and kids.,17,11

With a Dune 2 like legs, it should cross 10 million dollars and push close to 12 million

The RoundUp Punishment: Only slipped 48% from last weekend as the movie continues to push past milestones. 11 million admits was ate today

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: Has pretty big misstep with a 63% drop from last weekend. Will try to push past a million admits for its big milestone.

Garfield: A solid 44% drop from last weekend but not as great as one would hope for an animated kids movie. 

IF: A not good 55% drop from last weekend. 

Challengers: A good 43% drop from last weekend as 600k is pretty much the final accomplishment it could hit

KP4: A 52% drop from last weekend

However, it does seem that these two are headed for another showdown, as there are no new wide releases next week...

Furiosa beated Garfield on the 3-day OW with a difference of ~$770,000, and I'm pretty sure that gap could change between both movies next week...

Since family/animated movies tend to hold on well after OW, critical reception be damned, and since action movies tend to be usually front-loaded on OW, there's a shot at Garfield switching places with Furiosa and taking the crown next week, but since they both got the same B+ Cinemascore, which is not good for their respective genres, it could be anybody's game at this point...

Again, both movies are performing badly, but who will REALLY end up on top next week...?

Last Summer we had...

A Disney Marvel movie, Pixar movie, Disney live action remake, Mission Impossible movie, Fast and Furious movie, Transformers movie, Indiana Jones movie, TMNT movie...etc.

The excuse last year for why so many movies were underperforming was franchise fatigue or bad movie fatigue. It took a once in a lifetime pop culture event to save the summer box office and just make it respectable instead of a disaster.

So, is it a product problem?

Yet here amidst the wannabe executives there are people who talk about how streaming is superior and how it's a good thing theaters are closing down. I just find that insane. I know some people are cynical about the future of cinema but it sounds like a good amount of people are just genuinely hoping for the downfall of the theater-going experience when that's what movies were built on.

20) Migration	(127M)

21)	Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom	(124M)

23)	Scream VI	(108M)

24) The Flash	 (108M)

So far this year, we have 5:

1) Dune: Part Two	 (282M)

2) Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire	(195M)

3) Kung Fu Panda 4	(193M)

4) Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes	 (113M)

5)	Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (112M)

For the rest of the year:

May:

-*IF* has a shot but it is hard.

-*Furiosa* doesn't look like it is gonna make it.

-*Garfield* is more likely but could easily fall short.

June:

-Bad Boys: Ride or Die

-Inside Out 2

-A Quiet Place: Day One

July:

- Despicable Me 4

-Twisters

- Deadpool and Wolverine

August:

-Alien: Romulus

September:

-Beetlejuice Beetlejuice

-*Transformers One* is the other with a chance and I don't think it will.

October:

-Joker: Folie √† Deux

-Venom: The Last Dance

- *Smile 2* has a fair shot if it follows the first one.

-November:

-Gladiator 2

-Moana 2

-Wicked

-*Red One* could do it. Dwayne Johnson is hated online now but has been able to bring audiences to movies that look bad on paper before.

December:

-Mufasa: The Lion King

-Sonic 3

-*Kraven the Hunter* and *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim* have a slim chance but I wouldn't bet on either of them.",10,12

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle**

- Flip (Looking at some theaters near me, Haikyu is outselling Spy x Family (May 20).)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.41M/$4.47M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $2.61M THU. All these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18 so that'll go down. Feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find good comps (May 19). Numbers are from last THU, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $4.47M EA+THU.)

- keysersoze123 (This wont be fan driven. Even the last one initially trailed Dr Do little in presales but amped up big time close to release. | This will be a late bloomer. I am still expecting 50m+ OW (May 23).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $4.11M THU. Comps ($4.11M) would mean $40M+ Opening Weekend (May 24). Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- TwoMisfits (Aging male-skewing franchises tend to get the biggest bump from this deal. Folks are on the fence but know what they are getting. Female skewing non-sequel ones tend to get zero help.  You need baseline interest to get people willing to pay anything, b/c these still are $5.  The other effect of the deal is that movies releasing around the $5 hits sometimes get hurt. | June TMobile $5 Atom movie. This could help it go huge, like last year's Spider-Verse (May 22).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.5M THU. I still expect this to be more walk up friendly than the comps being used, and should see a gradual rise as the date gets closer (May 25). Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20). Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. Very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

- YM! (Same thing as IO2 for Bad Boys (see May 23 IO2 comment), I expect this to not only skew more GA friendly and should bulk up ticket sales as we get closer to release. It‚Äôs almost at half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 which is a pretty great thing. Should easily outdo it by T-6 imho (May 23). Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.56M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $3.98M THU. Good update, hopefully this keeps on rising (May 23). Not impressed at all so far here sadly (May 19). Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here (May 15).)

- AniNate (Finally a little movement here. 23 Thursday, 52 Fri-Sun (compared to 18 THU and 23 FRI-SUN on May 17) (May 22). Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 THU preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first THU at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the THU previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on THU for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder (Comp: $12.33M THU at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- Flip (Fan event on the 16th has 43 tickets sold from 2 showtimes (compared to 8 showtimes and 73 tickets sold for previews), so that might be depressing previews a bit

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $6.37M THU. Early sales haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18). At 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (Chugging along at this point (May 19). Show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective, easily the biggest for any animated movie in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $8.35M THU.  Decided to add Nope ($12.62M) to the comp block.  Not because I think it's a particularly good one (the ATP differences alone are a major red flag), but more for pace considerations considering how similar horror and kids animation are when it comes to being backloaded.  The other consideration with Nope is that it was on sale for nearly two weeks longer, so it did have a small amount of extra time to pad some seats sold.  But maybe the errors (ATP vs length of pre-sale) will cancel each other out.  PROBABLY NOT!  But the pace at the very least should be interesting (May 25).  10.0% Matinee sales, 5.3% 3D sales and 42.2% PLF sales. (May 19). Strange pre-sale pattern. Was there some sort of promo that dropped today?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (May 16). I do not have good comps, especially for D1.  5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Will it be as backloaded as Elemental?  It's tough to sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days, so perhaps not.  But it does show how backloaded purely kids animation is. Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales. Of presales, 3.5% are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the SAT of release weekend (NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost OW slightly depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $8.74M THU. Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18). This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for THU (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for THU (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for THU at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base THU rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow (Comp: $5.6M THU. It's starting to grow (May 25). I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19). No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of PLFs, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the PLFs (May 15).)

- YM! (Little has changed as IO2 keeps on trucking along. I do theorize at least from the 250 ticket selling Funko Event, it‚Äôs plausible families and fans went for that date instead of Thursday night previews. Not much to make of things until we get to around 2 weeks for rudimentary guessing and opening week for figuring things out. At the very least, I like that it doubled its previous sales a week ago as it shows pace and outdid Garfield‚Äôs T-6 (May 23). Did some snooping around for the Funko Event as I was curious if perhaps families getting presales for the opening Saturday vs opening Thursday as those sales are kind of weak Thursday and uhm it‚Äôs at 250 tickets. Which is like 5 times Garfield‚Äôs EA showing of 50 tickets all at PLF prices despite normal theaters. Most of which at 9:30 AM with only one theater having it at 11:00 AM (May 22). Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M THU comp and $22.2M FRI comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True FRI although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the THU average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount TUES so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20). Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event. Pretty solid for what it is. Majestic is healthy and about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn (May 17). Only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a THU . It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp: $32.20M**

- AMC (""Some 200,000 movie fans have bought their AMC tickets already. This is more Day 1 ticket sales at AMC than for any other R-rated movie ever."" Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that first-day sales are likely around $8 million to $9 million if extrapolating the 200,000 stat cited by Aron (May 22).)

- DEADLINE (Already heating up eight weeks before its debut, having already collected some $8M in first day ticket sales. $8M is pretty remarkable for an R-rated movie two months before release. While there are no direct comps on Deadpool & Wolverine ticket sales in post-Covid history, its current cash bests the 24-hour advance ticket sales of The Batman ($6.5M), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($6M) and John Wick: Chapter 4 ($1.4M). The Batman and GOTG3 opened to respective 3-day weekends of $134M and $118.4M (May 22).)

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. Best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M THU. Pretty damn great day 2!(May 21).)

- AniNate (THU sales still largely biased towards primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not enough for people to take off work early. | Good lord already 80+ THU previews sold for Deadpool at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! Already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $30.03M THU. Nearly 300 sales day vs ~260 by Black Panther & ~200 of GOTG3. Another brilliant day. Given the length of sales window, comps be falling off but they have remained steady for first 4 days (May 24). Looking at keysersoze123's MTC1 data: These are incredible (May 22). $40.22M THU (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $25.69M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $31.04M/$38.62M/$40.21M/$22.35M (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver THU: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- keysersoze123 (1st few days of PS is all about fanboys so T-x does not matter. By this FRI it will be in steady state mode. With this long a cycle that would be at very low levels. | Looking at FRI sales, its IM will be closer to Thor 4 than BP2. So we can do the projections based on how the previews will go. However Its really early. Let us wait until we have T-x comps. Probably will have to wait until July to get credible comps. | MTC2 early sales tend to be way weaker for all movies. The disparity for big movies is even higher.  | Nothing out of ordinary in day 2 pace for MTC1 (May 22). Obvious skew on previews (compared to FRI) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19). Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish.  I wonder where Deadpool 3 will land. Anything is fine as long as it does pull in a Marvels (May 17).)

- Legion Again (Previews this early in summer are almost a THU opening, so Fri soemthing like +35-55% from Th is IM ~4.9-5.5. If we get some strong Fri sales when we‚Äôre close maybe I‚Äôll drag it up to 5.6 or something but it will be really really tough to beat that. Expecting an IM close to Thor 4. Better reception (in avg case, just by regression to the mean) but bigger previews/more fanrush element, ~cancelling. | [T-65 Projection Matrix ($166M-$186M OW)](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/31569-the-box-office-buzz-tracking-and-pre-sale-thread/?do=findComment&comment=4680041) (May 22).)

- Porthos (Comp: $20.93M THU. For long releases of MCU/SW Saga caliber, it usually takes about 6 to 8 days for the initial wave to stop. The Rise of Skywalker didn't really ""bottom out"" until D9 or so (T-51).  Then at T-21, more or less, it started up its acceleration again. Can see similar patterns for MCU long runners (May 24). MCU/SW films tend to have a bit longer of a slope-down on the decent of the ""u-curve"" so I think I'll keep posting ""Day x"" comps for at least a couple more days (May 23). Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M THU Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20). | No comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close is Captain Marvel (T-58) and only other Disney release is TROS (T-59).  Longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi (~70 days). Longest major release since Fast X's 99 days.  Probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 days. Length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat. It's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS MON opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($150M locked imo.  Don‚Äôt really see under $30M for previews and a 6x multi gets it to $180M OW. With GOTG 3 early reception I think $200M becomes a real discussion (May 22). $44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. Sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M THU GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THU COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane. Has almost 200 more showings than Inside Out 2.  Sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). Also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and it's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- Tinalera (For a movie this far out, yea presales are doing well in Vancouver and Calgary. Its hard as very few movies open this early, but its healthy when we are getting between 5-10 percent sales for a movie not due out for 2 months (May 24).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark presale sets for DP3... 3 screens and 15 showings each - the PLF is giving 1 of 2 PLF screens and the non-PLF is doing some 3d showings. Not the set that a normal ""big"" Marvel movie gets, but it seems my 2 locals have taken a ""put up or shut up"" strategy for almost all blockbusters lately. This IS equal or more than most everything lately (although Bad Boys 4 is getting 3 screens and 14 showings at my PLF, so...). But, compared to 2019 Marvel, or even 2021 or EVEN 2023 Marvel...this is a low set (May 19).)

- vafrow (Comp: $45.2M THU. 12% over two days is pretty strong once the rush passes. We're not at the bottom of the curve yet it seems (May 24). 8% growth at this stage is very positive. I expect another drop tomorrow, but I'm probably not going to touch this until the weekend at this stage. I'm comping high, and without a proper MCU comparison (Marvels doesn't count), it's hard to gauge, but I feel this is just doing really well here (May 22). 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards PLFs in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start. Definitely feels like we got a potential 25m previews/150m+ opener. Still don't buy 200m OW but am starting to see 30m previews/175m+ OW as a strong possibility. | On its first day has sold over 10x Furiosa T-6 here in SE Wisconsin. At North Shore, 70% of Shang-Chi‚Äôs and Venom 2‚Äôs T-2, 47% of Homecoming‚Äôs T-2, and 41.25% of Thor: Ragnar√∂k‚Äôs T-2 - just using DP&W‚Äôs T-66! | At half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-4 sales here in the past ten minutes in just two of the theaters PLF shows (May 20). 42 showings for previews across four SE Wisconsin theaters I track. ~20% more showings than IO2 and about the same amount of PLFs spread. Likely 3-4 screens a theater for THU previews, but has SuperScreen + 2 UltraScreen screens in Majestic Cinema. Seems to be a 3D push with North Shore having primetime showings in 3D UltraScreen (May 19).)

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Robert Zemeckis' turn.

As a child, Zemeckis loved television and was fascinated by his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. After seeing *Bonnie and Clyde* with his father, Zemeckis decided that he wanted to go to film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, but he still went to USC, where he meet his colleague Bob Gale. One of his student films caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, who decided to become an executive producer and help him with his career.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, some of the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978)**

*""It isn't fatal, but it sure is fun.""*

His directorial debut. It stars Nancy Allen, Bobby Di Cicco, Marc McClure, Susan Kendall Newman, Theresa Saldana, Eddie Deezen, and Wendie Jo Sperber. Its story follows a disparate group of teenagers over the course of one day in New York City as they attempt to gain entry to the Beatles' first live appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on February 9, 1964.

The reason behind the film's existence was that Steven Spielberg was confident Zemeckis could make a feature length film after watching his student films. So he signed as executive producer, his first credit. But Universal was not thrilled with the concept and handing the production to an unexperienced director. To bankroll it, Spielberg had to promise studio executives that, if Zemeckis was seen to be doing a markedly poor job, he would step in and direct the film himself.

Despite the backing of a major studio, the film flopped with just $1.9 million domestically. But it received very positive reviews, so there was interest in giving Zemeckis another chance. 

- **Budget:** $2,800,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $1,944,682. ($9.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,944,682.

#**Used Cars (1980)**

*""Like new, great looking, and fully loaded with laughs.""*

His second film. It stars Kurt Russell, Jack Warden, Frank McRae, David L. Lander, Michael McKean, Joe Flaherty, Al Lewis, Dub Taylor, Harry Northup, Dick Miller, and Betty Thomas. The story follows Rudy Russo, a devious salesman, working for affable, but monumentally unsuccessful used-car dealer Luke Fuchs. Luke's principal rival, located directly across the street, is his more prosperous brother, Roy L. Fuchs, who is scheming to take over Luke's lot. 

Like his previous film, it received good reviews but it was a box office flop. Zemeckis really needed a hit now.

- **Budget:** $8,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $11,715,321. ($44.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $11,715,321.

#**Romancing the Stone (1984)**

*""She's a girl from the big city. He's a reckless soldier of fortune. For a fabulous treasure, they share an adventure no one could imagine... or survive.""*

His third film. It stars Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito. The film follows a romance novelist who must venture beyond her New York City comfort zone to Colombia in order to save her sister from criminals who are holding her for ransom.

The film received very positive reviews, with many favorably comparing it to *Raiders of the Lost Ark*. And after a streak of bad luck, the box office finally rewarded Zemeckis, as the film earned over $100 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $10,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $75,078,260. ($226.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $115,078,260.

#**Back to the Future (1985)**

*""He was never in time for his classes. He wasn't in time for his dinner. Then one day... he wasn't in his time at all.""*

His fourth film. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, it follows Marty McFly, a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, where he inadvertently prevents his future parents from falling in love ‚Äì threatening his own existence ‚Äì and is forced to reconcile them and somehow get back to the future.

In 1980, Bob Gale visited his parents and took a look at his father's high school yearbook. He wondered if he and his father would have been friends had they attended school together. He did not think so, but realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age. He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother's childhood stories were often contradictory. They believed many time-travel films focused on the past being immutable and wanted to show the past being altered and the effect those changes would have on the future. 

In the first drafts, Doc was a video pirate and the time machine was a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck. Originally, Marty's actions in 1955 had a more significant impact on the future, making 1985 more futuristic and advanced, but every person who read the script took issue with the idea. Another huge aspect is that the drained time machine was written to be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion, combined with an additional ingredient: Coca-Cola. 

They gave the second draft to Columbia Pictures president Frank Price, but he considered it way too ""tame"" compared to the raunchy hits of the 80s. Multiple studios rejected the script, as they felt the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth as well as the recent box office failure of time travel films. They only had Steven Spielberg's support, but they feared they'd have to rely solely on him to get their scripts greenlit. So Zemeckis temporarily left to make *Romancing the Stone*, and its box office success allowed him to gain more credibility. Spielberg got involved as executive producer, and set the project at Universal. Price was now working there, but Spielberg ensured that he had zero impact on the production. 

Michael J. Fox was the first choice to play Marty, as Zemeckis and Gale were impressed by his work in the sitcom *Family Ties*. But the show's producer Gary David Goldberg did not give Fox the script. With Fox out, Sid Sheinberg preferred Eric Stoltz, who had impressed with his portrayal of Rocky Dennis in an early screening of the drama film *Mask*. With the filming date approaching, Zemeckis opted for Stoltz. Sheinberg promised that if Stoltz did not work out, they could reshoot the film. At the same time, Christopher Lloyd signed as Doc and Melora Hardin as Jennifer.

Filming began on November 26, 1984, and the tight schedule meant that editing occurred concurrently with filming. On December 30, Zemeckis reviewed the existing scenes with his editors, and he believed Stoltz's acting was not working and had already listed several scenes he wanted to reshoot. Zemeckis called in Gale and the producers to show them the footage; they agreed Stoltz was not right for the part. Stoltz was performing the role with an intense and serious tone, not the ""screwball"" energy they desired. Spielberg finally got Goldberg to let Fox sign, and filming continued without informing Stoltz that he would be replaced. One week after Fox agreed, Stoltz was finally fired, and the crew said they deemed this ""good news"" despite having to reshoot the film. As a result, Hardin was also fired as the crew felt she was too tall for Fox. 

On January 15, 1985, Fox started filming his scenes. By that point, the film lost 34 days of filming and the reshoots meant that the budget had to increase by $4 million, which included Soltz getting his full salary despite not finishing the film. This also prompted Universal to mount a PR campaign to mitigate the negative buzz for replacing the lead actor. Fox filmed *Family Ties* during the day before traveling to the *Back to the Future* filming location. Often, he would not return home until early the following morning, and on weekends, the schedule was pushed back further as *Family Ties* was filmed in front of a live audience. Filming wrapped in April, and Zemeckis was pressured to complete editing, especially when Sheinberg decided to move up the date to July 3. 

The film opened with $11.3 million on its first weekend, ranking #1. It eased an absurd 5% in its second weekend and added $10.5 million. After losing the top spot on its fourth weekend, it returned to #1 on its fifth weekend and it stayed there for 8 weeks. It didn't have a drop higher than 10.2% until its tenth weekend. It simply had incredible legs, and in October, it passed *Rambo: First Blood Part II* ($149 million) as the year's highest grossing title. It stayed in theaters for almost an entire year, and it closed with an extraordinary $211 million domestically ($214 million through re-releases). Worldwide, the film was also a huge success, earning $381 million ($384 million through re-releases). 

The film received an incredible response from critics and audiences, quickly earning a place among the greatest sci-fi films ever made. It became one of the most influential and beloved films in history, and massively increased the careers of Zemeckis and Fox. Universal wanted a sequel, but Zemeckis and Gale were not interested.

- **Budget:** $15,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $214,077,472. ($623.8 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $384,577,472.

#**Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)**

*""It's the story of a man, a woman, and a rabbit in a triangle of trouble.""*

His fifth film. Loosely based on the novel *Who Censored Roger Rabbit?* by Gary K. Wolf, it stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd, Stubby Kaye, Joanna Cassidy, and the voices of Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. Combining live-action and animation, the film is set in an alternate history Hollywood in 1947, where humans and cartoon characters (referred to as ""toons"") co-exist. Its plot follows Eddie Valiant, a private investigator with a grudge against toons, who must help exonerate Roger Rabbit, a toon framed for murder.

Disney bought the film rights in 1981, and Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were hired to write the script. Zemeckis offered himself to direct, but Disney didn't trust him as the only two films he made by that point were box office duds. By 1985, Amblin Entertainment got involved as producers, and Disney greenlit the project when the film was set at $30 million. They offered the film to Terry Gilliam, but he declined because he felt it was too technically challenging (a decision he said regrets to this day). After the success of *Romancing the Stone* and *Back to the Future*, Zemeckis was finally granted the director's chair. 

With his involvement, Spielberg convinced Warner Bros., Fleischer Studios, Harvey Comics, King Features Syndicate, Felix the Cat Productions, Turner Entertainment, and Universal Pictures/Walter Lantz Productions to ""lend"" their characters to appear in the film with (in some cases) stipulations on how those characters were portrayed. For this, Donald Duck and Daffy Duck appear as equally talented dueling pianists, while Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny also share a scene. Among the characters they were unable to use were Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu, Casper, or the Terrytoons characters. 

For the effects, mime artists, puppeteers, mannequins, and robotic arms were commonly used during filming to help the actors interact with ""open air and imaginative cartoon characters."" This caused the budget to escalate, while the shooting schedule ran longer than expected. When the budget reached $40 million, Disney CEO Michael Eisner seriously considered shutting down production, but studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg talked him out of it. Despite the budget escalating to over $50 million, Disney moved forward on production because they were enthusiastic to work with Spielberg.

The film opened with $11 million, which was Disney's biggest debut ever. It had fantastic legs, closing with $154 million domestically and $351 million worldwide, making it the year's second highest grossing film. It received extraordinary reviews for its groundbreaking special effects, winning 4 Oscars for Film Editing, Sound Effects, Visual Effects and a Special Achievement Award. It became one of the most influential films, as no film properly combined animation and live-action as efficient as this film. Zemeckis quickly became a big star. He said he's open to a sequel, even after Hoskins' death in 2014, claiming that there's a ""wonderful"" script he read. However, he said it was unlikely that Disney would greenlight it, as ""the current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all.""

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $154,112,492. ($408.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $351,500,000.

#**Back to the Future Part II (1989)**

*""Getting back was only the beginning.""*

His sixth film. The sequel to *Back to the Future*, it stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, Elisabeth Shue, and Jeffrey Weissman. It follows Marty McFly and his friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown as they travel from 1985 to 2015 to prevent Marty's son from sabotaging the McFly family's future. When their arch-nemesis Biff Tannen steals Doc's DeLorean time machine and uses it to alter history for his benefit, the duo must return to 1955 to restore the timeline.

Zemeckis and Gale did not plan for the original film to get a sequel, the final scene was just a nice send-off that suggested they would have adventures off-screen. But after the huge success, Universal convinced them in a sequel. Zemeckis and Gale would later regret that they ended the first one with Jennifer in the car with Marty and Doc Brown, because it required them to come up with a story that would fit her in, rather than a whole new adventure. With the size of the story, Zemeckis and Gale decided to make two sequels, shot back-to-back to save money. Claudia Wells had to drop out due to a family crisis, so Elisabeth Shue replaced her and re-shot the final scene of the previous film. 

It was one of ILM's first forays into digital compositing, as well as the VistaGlide motion control camera system, which enabled them to shoot one of its most complex sequences, in which Fox played three separate characters (Marty Sr., Marty Jr., and Marlene), all of whom interacted with each other. Although such scenes were not new, the VistaGlide allowed, for the first time, a completely dynamic scene in which camera movement could finally be incorporated. The technique was also used in scenes where Fox, Thomas F. Wilson, Christopher Lloyd, and Elisabeth Shue's characters encounter and interact with their counterparts.

Rather than write George out of the film, Zemeckis used previously filmed footage of Glover from the first film as well as new footage of actor Jeffrey Weissman, who wore prosthetics including a false chin, nose, and cheekbones to resemble Glover. Glover filed a lawsuit against the producers of the film on the grounds that they neither owned his likeness nor had permission to use it. As a result of the suit, there are now clauses in the Screen Actors Guild collective bargaining agreements stating that producers and actors are not allowed to use such methods to reproduce the likeness of other actors. 

Highly anticipated, the film opened with $27 million on its first weekend, breaking the Thanksgiving record. But while the original film had insane legs, this one wasn't quite strong. It closed with $119 million domestically, a steep 45% drop. It actually increased overseas, which allowed the film to close with $332 million worldwide. The film drew mixed reactions, particularly for its story and darker tone. In subsequent years, its reputation grew, although it was still considered inferior to the original. 

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $119,000,002. ($300.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $332,500,002.

#**Back to the Future Part III (1990)**

*""They've saved the best trip for last... but this time they may have gone too far.""*

His seventh film. The final installment in the *Back to the Future* trilogy, it stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson, and Lea Thompson. The film continues immediately following *Part II*; while stranded in 1955, Marty discovers that ""Doc, trapped in 1885, was killed by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, Biff's great-grandfather. Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with Clara Clayton.

While filming the original, Zemeckis talked with Fox over what kind of film he would like to make, and Fox said he wanted to make an Old West film. Zemeckis and Gale were intrigued and decided to have the third film set in the Old West. To save costs, the films were shot back-to-back, and it took nine months to film the two movies. Although the schedule for most of the personnel involved was grueling, the actors found the remote location for *Part III* relaxing, compared to shooting its predecessor.

It released six months after *Part II* opened, and just 3 days after that film hit VHS. The film opened with $19 million ($23 million for the four-day Memorial weekend), far below the projections. It closed with $88 million domestically and $245 million, marking another drop from the previous films. It received a favorable response, and was considered a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Despite Universal wanting a fourth film or reboot, Zemeckis and Gale have said they will block all attempts to reboot the franchise.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $88,277,583. ($211.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $245,077,583.

#**Death Becomes Her (1992)**

*""In one small bottle... the fountain of youth. The secret of eternal life. The power of an ancient potion. Sometimes it works... sometimes it doesn't.""*

His eighth film. The film stars Meryl Streep, Goldie Hawn, Bruce Willis, and Isabella Rossellini. Its plot follows two women who fight for the affections of the same man and drink a magic potion that promises eternal youth.

The film was a technologically complex film to make, and represented a major advancement in the use of computer-generated effects, under the pioneering direction of ILM. It was the first film where computer-generated skin texture was used. Streep admitted that she disliked working on a project that focused so heavily on special effects and vowed never to work on another film with heavy special effects again.

The film received mixed reviews; while the effects were praised, the humor was criticized. But with the trio's star power, the film earned $149 million, becoming a box office success. Its reputation grew with time, and it won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $58,422,650. ($130.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $149,022,650.

#**Forrest Gump (1994)**

*""The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.""*

His ninth film. Based on the novel by Winston Groom, it stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field. The film follows the life of Forrest Gump, a man with low IQ, who recounts the early years of his life when he found himself in the middle of key historical events. All he wants now is to be reunited with his childhood sweetheart, Jenny.

The novel's success prompted a bidding war, with Warner Bros. winning the film rights. Groom was paid $500,000 and also wrote the first three first drafts of the screenplay, which leaned closer to the events of the novel. After *Rain Man* told the story of a savant, WB lost interest in the picture, and by 1990 the project was in turnaround. Columbia Pictures rejected the project, but Paramount picked it up just as Eric Roth joined as screenwriter. Ivan Reitman, Penny Marshall and Terry Gilliam passed on the project, while Barry Sonnenfeld was attached to direct, but left to work on *Addams Family Values*. Afterwards, Zemeckis joined to direct. 

Once again, Zemeckis had another film with groundbreaking special effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Forrest meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.

On its opening weekend, the film opened with $24 million. Buoyed by extraordinary word of mouth, the film decreased just 1.3% in its second weekend. By its third weekend, the film already broke the $100 million milestone in the United States. For the first twelve weeks of release, the film was in the top 3 at the US box office, topping the list 5 times, including in its tenth week of release. It spent almost one year in theaters. It eventually closed with a colossal $330 million domestically, making it the highest grossing film of the year in the United States. Even with its American focus, it was also a worldwide phenomenon; it earned $678 million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest grossing film ever. It was also Zemeckis' highest grossing film, as well as Paramount's biggest film. 

The film received critical acclaim, and has been referred as one of the world's most beloved and iconic films. It received 13 Oscar nominations and won 6: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. Zemeckis was just unstoppable. There were talks to adapt the novel's sequel, *Gump & Co.*, but the film is stuck in development hell. Roth submitted his draft on September 10, 2001. After 9/11, Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer ""relevant.""

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $330,455,270. ($699.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $678,226,465.

#**Contact (1997)**

*""If it's just us, it seems like an awful waste of space.""*

His tenth film. Based on the novel by Carl Sagan, it stars Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, William Fichtner, John Hurt, Angela Bassett, Rob Lowe, Jake Busey, and David Morse. It follows Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway, a SETI scientist who finds evidence of extraterrestrial life and is chosen to make first contact.

Sagan and his wife Ann Druyan chose to adapt his own novel. They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact. Zemeckis was offered the director's chair, and while he liked the script, he said the very last page was the reason he decided to turn it down. WB hired George Miller instead, and he cast Jodie Foster to play Ellie. However, Miller spent so much time in pre-production that WB chose to fire him and convinced Zemeckis to finally direct, granting him total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.

The film received a positive response, although some felt that the film prioritized scientific accuracy over storytelling. It earned $171 million worldwide, although that didn't look quite good against its $90 million budget. 

- **Budget:** $90,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $100,920,329. ($197.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $171,120,329.

#**What Lies Beneath (2000)**

*""He was the perfect husband until his one mistake followed them home.""*

His 11th film. It stars Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, James Remar and Miranda Otto. The film follows a marriage who moves to the husband's old house, where the wife experiences disturbing supernatural activity. Soon, she discovers a shocking truth about her husband and Madison, his student who is dead.

Documentary filmmaker Sarah Kernochan had adapted a personal experience with the paranormal as a script treatment featuring a retirement aged couple dealing with restless but compassionate spirits. DreamWorks commissioned a rewrite from actor-writer Clark Gregg (Agent Coulson). Spielberg decided to give the project to Zemeckis, who managed to film the entire movie while another film of his shut down production (we'll get to that later on). At $100 million, it was the most expensive horror film ever.

The film received mixed reviews, particularly for its script. But the star power of Ford and Pfeiffer translated into a great box office run, as the film earned almost $300 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $100,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $155,464,351. ($283 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $291,420,351.

#**Cast Away (2000)**

*""At the edge of the world, his journey begins.""*

His 12th film. It stars Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt, and Nick Searcy. It follows a FedEx troubleshooter who is stranded on an uninhabited island after his plane crashes in the South Pacific, and the plot focuses on his desperate attempts to survive and return home.

Hanks wanted to make a film that would ""examine the concept of four years of hopelessness, in which you have none of the requirements for living ‚Äî food, water, shelter, fire and company."" William Broyles was brought to write the film, and Zemeckis soon joined as director and Hanks gaining 50 pounds for the role. The film started filming in January 1999 and was paused two months later, so Hanks could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. Filming didn't continue until April 2000. During that one-year gap, Zemeckis filmed *What Lies Beneath*. FedEx provided access to their equipment, but paid no money on product placement. 

The film was well received, and the reunion of Zemeckis and Hanks provided another box office hit, as the film earned over $400 million worldwide. Hanks was later nominated for Best Actor at the Oscars, losing to Russell Crowe on *Gladiator*. Zemeckis was on fire.

- **Budget:** $90,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $233,632,142. ($425.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $429,632,142.

#**The Polar Express (2004)**

*""Believe.""*

His 13th film. Based on the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, it stars Tom Hanks, Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen. Set on Christmas Eve, it tells the story of a young boy who sees a mysterious train bound for the North Pole stop outside his window and is invited aboard by its conductor. He joins other children as they embark on a journey to visit Santa Claus, who is preparing for Christmas.

Hanks optioned the book in 1999 after reading the book to his children with the hopes of playing the conductor and Santa Claus. Van Allsburg was skeptical over selling the rights, but sold them after Hanks asked, under the condition that it wouldn't be animated as he feared this would not accurately represent his characters. Rob Reiner was hired to direct, but he was replaced by Zemeckis when the film was delayed. He brought in William Broyles to rewrite the script; their new draft expanded the roles of minor characters such as Hero Girl, Know-it-all, and Lonely Boy. It also added the new character of Hobo. 

Despite Van Allsburg's original terms with Hanks, Zemeckis felt that a live-action version was unfeasible, claiming that it ""would look awful, and it would be impossible ‚Äì it would cost $1 billion instead of $160 million"". Zemeckis felt that such a version would rob the audience of the art style of the book which he felt was ""so much a part of the emotion of the story"". However, Zemeckis also agreed that a conventional animated version would suit the film poorly. In order to keep his vision, a new process was created by which actors would be filmed with motion capture equipment in a black box stage which would then be animated to make the resulting film. This cost $1 million per minute of footage, and Hanks played 5 characters through this. It was recognized as the first all-digital capture film, and with $170 million, it was the most expensive animated film by that point. 

The film attracted mixed reactions, as many were conflicted over the character animation. But word of mouth was far stronger; it was a box office success after earning $318 million worldwide through re-releases. But why was it a success if the budget was $170 million? Easy, because it was colossal in DVD and Christmas reruns. To this day, the film is still massively popular during the holiday season.

- **Budget:** $170,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $189,528,738. ($314.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $318,321,815.

#**Beowulf (2007)**

*""Evil breeds pain.""*

His 14th film. Based on the Old English epic poem, it features the voices of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, John Malkovich, Crispin Glover, Alison Lohman, and Angelina Jolie. The film depicts the rise and fall of the warrior Beowulf after he travels to Denmark to kill a monster. 

Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary wrote a screen adaptation of *Beowulf* in May 1997. The project was set up at DreamWorks with Avary slated to direct and Zemeckis producing. Avary stated he wanted to make a small-scale, gritty film with a budget of $15‚Äì20 million, similar to *Jabberwocky* or *Excalibur*. The project was then stuck in development hell. Producer Steve Bing, at the behest of Zemeckis who was wanting to direct the film himself, revived the production by convincing Avary that Zemeckis' vision, supported by the strength of digitally enhanced live action, was worth relinquishing the directorial reins. 

The film received very positive reviews, who noted it as an improvement over *The Polar Express*. But the massive $150 million budget made it difficult to be profitable, and the film closed with just $196 million worldwide. 

- **Budget:** $150,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $82,280,579. ($124.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $196,393,745.

#**A Christmas Carol (2009)**

*""Season's greedings.""*

His 15th film. Based on Charles Dickens's novel, it stars the voices of Jim Carrey, Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Bob Hoskins, Robin Wright and Cary Elwes. It follows Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly old moneylender who is visited by three Christmas spirits on Christmas Eve. Scrooge embarks on a journey of self-redemption to mend his miserly ways.

After making *The Polar Express*, Zemeckis stated that he ""fell in love with digital theater"" and tried finding an avenue in order to use the format again. He eventually decided that an adaptation of Charles Dickens's *A Christmas Carol* would be an opportunity to achieve this. He collaborated with Disney on the project, marking their first film since *Who Framed Roger Rabbit*. 

The film received mixed reviews for its tone and animation. It earned $325 million worldwide, but the massive costs meant that it was a flop. That's 3 box office duds in a row. 

- **Budget:** $200,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $137,855,863. ($201.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $325,286,646.

#**Flight (2012)**

His 16th film. The film stars Denzel Washington, Don Cheadle, Kelly Reilly, John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood and Melissa Leo. It follows William ""Whip"" Whitaker Sr., an alcoholic airline pilot who miraculously crash-lands his plane after a mechanical failure, saving nearly everyone on board. Although hailed a hero, an investigation soon begins to cast the captain in a different light.

It marked Zemeckis' first R-rated film since *Used Cars*. It received very positive reviews, and was a much needed box office success for him. 

- **Budget:** $31,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $93,772,375. ($128 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $161,772,375.

#**The Walk (2015)**

*""Dream high.""*

His 17th film. The film stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ben Kingsley, Charlotte Le Bon, James Badge Dale, Ben Schwartz, and Steve Valentine, and is based on the story of French high-wire artist Philippe Petit's walk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. 

Despite good reviews, it was another box office bomb for Zemeckis, and it marked his first film to earn less than $100 million since *Used Cars*.

- **Budget:** $45,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $10,137,502. ($13.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $61,181,942.

#**Allied (2016)**

*""The enemy is listening.""*

His 18th film. It stars Brad Pitt, Marion Cotillard, Jared Harris, Simon McBurney and Lizzy Caplan. It follows a Canadian intelligence officer and a French Resistance fighter who fall in love while posing as a married couple during a mission in Casablanca in 1942, but the wife is suspected of being a German spy. 

The film received mixed reviews, and marked another box office dud for Zemeckis.

- **Budget:** $113,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $40,098,064. ($52.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $119,520,023.

#**Welcome to Marwen (2018)**

*""You can't put this hero in a box.""*

His 19th film. The film stars Steve Carell, Leslie Mann, Diane Kruger, Merritt Wever, Janelle Mon√°e, Eiza Gonz√°lez, Gwendoline Christie, Leslie Zemeckis, Siobhan Williams and Neil Jackson. It tells the true story of Mark Hogancamp, a man struggling with PTSD who, after being physically assaulted, creates a fictional village to ease his trauma.

The film was poorly received, and it was his worst attended film since his debut in 1978.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $10,763,520. ($13.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $13,061,491.

#**The Witches (2020)**

His 20th film. Based on the novel by Roald Dahl, it stars Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, and Kristin Chenoweth. When an orphan encounters a witch, his grandmother takes him away in order to protect him. But, in their hotel, a group of witches plot to get rid of the children of the world.

Due to the pandemic, it was sent to HBO Max and played at select theaters worldwide, so it was a bomb. And a poorly received film again. 

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $203,571. ($246,625 adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $29,303,571.

#**Pinocchio (2022)**

His 21st film. A live-action remake of Disney's 1940 animated film, it stars Tom Hanks, Cynthia Erivo, and Luke Evans with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Keegan-Michael Key, and Lorraine Bracco in voice roles. The story follows a wooden puppet named Pinocchio, who is brought to life by a blue fairy after being crafted by an old Italian woodcarver named Geppetto.

As it's a Disney+ original, there are no box office numbers here. What we have, however, is that it had awful reviews, with some considering it as Zemeckis' worst film. 

#**The Future**

His next film is a *Forrest Gump* reunion. The film is *Here*, which is written by Eric Roth and stars Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. The story covers the events of a single spot of land and its inhabitants spanning from the past to well into the future. It opens this November.

He made 21 films, but only 20 went to theaters. Across those 20 films, he has made $4,386,656,865 worldwide. That's $219,332,843 per film.

#**The Verdict**

His run through the 80s and 90s was just insane. Banger after banger, and films that could change the landscape of what movies were possible. To this day, these films have remained popular and he earned a place as one of the most bankable names in film business. 

Starting on the 21st Century, however, you notice how the cracks start to appear. Bankable for a few years, but he hasn't made a profitable film in 12 years, which by itself was his first profitable in 12 years. Some broke even at best, but others were colossal box office failures. And through his recent films, you can tell he has not been able to replicate another beloved film. Zemeckis may still use his 80s/90s run to justify getting more films greenlit, but it's a foregone conclusion that his glory days are long past him.

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

With streaming becoming the dominant form of movie watching during lockdown, it seems that less and less people are going to the movies unless a film is a cultural event that must be seen on the big screen. 

While films like Barbie, Top Gun: Maverick, Avatar: The Way of Water, and the upcoming Deadpool and Wolverine can and will certainly give the market a much needed shot in the arm, this in my opinion is a best a temporary solution that doesn‚Äôt really fix the core issues at play. Relying solely on IP/franchise events to keep the industry afloat is in my view one of the primary reasons we‚Äôre in this predicament in the first place.

I suppose my question is: Is there a potential way to course correct in order to bring the audience back to pre-Covid numbers, or are we simply too far gone at this point to really fully recover?",219,168

Wonka, Dune: Part 2, Godzilla v Kong, Barbie, Oppenheimer, even the new Hunger Games movie, were all huge on social media and actually drove people to theaters. 

Some of the movies I mentioned weren‚Äôt even that good, but the FOMO (fear of missing out) sensation it caused online made people actually go to theaters so they could participate in the memes/jokes/discussions that were taking place online.

Any time these movies would release, my timeline would be full of baby Kong, Timoth√©e Chalamet, challengers memes, etc.

Other movies like The Fall Guy, Furiosa, Mission Impossible 7, The Creator, and more I can‚Äôt think of right now all failed to become viral/relevant on the main apps I mentioned, even though they‚Äôre excellent and got rave reviews. 

I think even Challengers benefited from the Twitter jokes. That movie could‚Äôve been an absolute embarrassment yet it‚Äôs holding on pretty well.

Also, Mad Max was never a major moneymaker. The first Mad Max flopped in the USA, The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome made money because they had a low budget for its genre. 

Mad Max: Fury Road might have made money hadn't it cost nearly 200 million dollars (which was due to delays and reshoots for nearly 4 years).

But yeah, it isnt making profit anytime soon except a miracle happens.

It's not a film you prolly would watch with your family, is not a pleasant movie to watch, is not a niche for very mainstream audiences, also the 35M bo is TUFF.

This year has been though, I dont think is ""The end"" like many people say, things in the world aren't just working out, strikes made more damage than people really thought and streaming still having its big momentum.

Mad Max is a wonderful saga, and Miller is the only one capable of making them so amazing, I still got hopes for the saga with a 3rd part even tho this one prolly wont even break even.

Anyways, the solution for many will be cutting those budgets, do what Sony does and see different results.

A notable bunch are If and Garfield.

Both of these films are marketed towards family audiences and require them to perform well. 

However they have chosen to release 3 different family films with a month apart from eachother.

As audiences are starting to get more picky with what films they end up seeing especially as ticket prices get more and more expensive I believe that families are holding off till Inside Out 2 to get their family movie fix.

The first three Kung Fu Panda movies cost $130-$150 million each and they came out from 2008-2016. The fourth movie came out in 2024 and only cost $85 million despite lots of inflation happening since then, while also keeping the animation quality pretty much the same. 

Croods 2 also had half the budget of the first one despite coming out seven years later. Puss in Boots 2 also cost less than the first one despite an 11 year time gap. The two Trolls sequels also cost less than the first movie. Their recent original movies like the Bad Guys and Ruby Gillman have also been pretty cheap. 

How did they manage to do this?

You can't flip through TV channels without seeing them promoting biscuits, shampoos, paints, phones, and more. In an interview, Shahrukh Khan revealed that he doesn't take upfront fees for his films, instead opting for backend profits if the film succeeds. This approach reduces the financial burden on the film's financiers. Over the past 30 years, he has endorsed thousands of products, and his net worth is estimated to be nearly a billion dollars. Similarly, Alia Bhatt, India's most successful actress, charges a relatively low frontend fee of $1-2 million and doesn't burden films with her hefty salary. Both actors earn around $15-20 million annually through endorsements and are richer than many A-list actors/actresses. 

Given the struggles of Hollywood films to recover their budgets, and the criticism of stars' salaries as a contributing factor, it makes sense for top A-list talent to follow the Bollywood model. The aura of 'exclusivity' and 'mystery' that A-list actors in Hollywood have traditionally cultivated is no longer a viable strategy. By endorsing products like musicians and athletes do, they can:

1. **Maintain relevance** with Gen-Z, who value constant engagement.
2. **Earn significant endorsement income**, potentially forgoing their $20 million frontend salaries and reducing the financial burden on film projects. Imagine Jennifer Lawrence promoting a film like No Hard Feelings for a reduced fee of $5 million and participating in backend profits.

Considering the challenges of inflated budgets and star salaries in Hollywood, it would be beneficial for A-list talent to endorse products extensively, reducing their massive salaries and easing the financial burden on films. ",7,0

The market hits ¬•42.8M/$5.9M which is up +47% versus yesterday and down -22% versus last week.

**The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** opens to a ridicoulously poor $140k. Half of projections. It one ups The Fall Guys dissater opening day from last week. Only looking at maybe a $500k opening weekend and will strugle to reach $1M total from that.

**Mothers Instict** starring Anne Hathaway opens to $43k outside of the top 20. Yeah idk. I didn't even know this movie existed until i saw it on the calendar. And then i forgot about it again until someone mentioned it yesterday.

Meanwhile **The Fall Guy** scores just $38k on its 2nd Friday pushing its total gross to $0.98M. -85% from last week. It will limp over the $1M total mark through the weekend.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Civil War and Furiosa on June 7th, IF on June 15th, Inside Out 2 on June 21st and Despicable Me 4 on July 12th

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! The Movie will also release at some point.


---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

Does anyone know how many theaters it's playing in?  I was waiting to see The-Numbers theater count story and it's not mentioned.

In NYC, it's playing in 5 theaters (Paris, Regal Union Square and 3 Alamos) so it has a similar footprint to The Killer's limited release back in the fall (also 2 weeks).

Disappointed that it's not getting a traditional studio theatrical release as it's an old-school audience-pleasing comedy but I guess Netflix offered Glen and Richard the best deal with its inevitable streaming success turbo-charging Twisters' box office and cementing Glen as a bankable star (or the closest to that these days).",7,8

* Another Weekend, another catastophe for German Movie Theaters. After a surprisingly decent first 3 months of the year, April & May have just been terrible for German Movie Theaters. The ""record"" for Worst Weekend of the Year gets broken multiple times. Almost all newcomers released in the last 2 months underperformed.

And even the few weekends with cold and rainy weather, which usually cause really good numbers from the Germany Box Office, where movies often increase from previous weekends, even those Weekends were kinda disappointing.

To say, that the last 2 months were disappointing is putting it mildly.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is set to be the lastest victim, the Film is expected to sell Ca. 120,000 tickets during it¬¥s Opening Weekend, including Previews.

As a comparison, Mad Max: Fury Road opened with 229,525 tickets.

This Film¬¥s Opening Weekend is also set to open lower than Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (132,244 tickets), Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (164,496 tickets), Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire (180,103 tickets) & The Beekeeper (165,381 tickets).

Meanwhile, this Film¬¥s Opening Weekend is set to be close to those from The Fall Guy (118,832 tickets) & Argylle (102,767 tickets).

  
Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is currently expected to have the 15th Biggest Opening Weekend of 2024, the 101st Biggest Opening Weekend since the Pandemic started and the Lowest Opening Weekend of a Mad Max Film.

Excluded (due to lack of data): Mad Max, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior

**Top 3 Biggest Mad Max Opening Weekends:**

1. Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome - 285,190 tickets

2. Mad Max: Fury Road - 229,525 tickets

3. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga - Ca. 120,000 tickets (including Previews)

* This could be the 3rd Weekend in a row with 2 Films in 1st place. The Garfield Movie is expected to be the #1 Film in Tickets sold for the 3rd Weekend in a row, while Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga is set to be the #1 Film in Box Office.

**The current projection for the Weekend:**

1. The Garfield Movie - 125,000 tickets -4.7%/ 567,500 tickets (3rd Weekend)
2. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga - 120,000 tickets (including Previews) (New)
3. IF - 77,500 tickets -18.7%/ 242,500 tickets (2nd Weekend)
4. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes - 70,000 tickets -37.3%/ 415,000 tickets (3rd Weekend)
5. The Fall Guy - 55,000 tickets -30.8%/ 477,500 tickets (4th Weekend)

* Of course, this is only a projection based on the Thursday & the Preview numbers of these films, so these numbers can still change in the coming days.

My next post about next Weekend¬¥s Final numbers will be released next Week, probably on tuesday or wednesday.",14,45

Fury Road was a pretty big hit back in the day btw, so the IP does have good will in Brazil (May 22). The flood once again messing things up: A huge marketing campaign was planned for Furiosa during the Brazilian Football Championship...however the championship have been delayed due to the floods. Warner is now planning ways to compensate this (May 17). Furiosa's pre-sales are around half of Planet of the Apes on the same period and around 25% lower than GxK also on the same period. Pre-sales aren't catching fire so far but to be honest it is not the kind of film to sell a lot early (May 16).)

Fury Road made a lot of noise back in 2015 - a lot of  headlines and awards and stellar reviews - but in actual numbers, it got little love with only 850k admissions total in the end. I'm not sure if Furiosa will do much better, the target demo seems narrow; however, it should open to #1 with a safe lead.

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

Last week, my tracking for IF gave mixed results as my **$2.19M** Thurs prediction came in over actuals while my **$8.27M** guesstimate actually came in under actuals for actuals just under my **$10.76M** Thurs+Fri opening.  For the horror audience, they came out just as anticipated for **The Stangers: Chapter 1** with a nearly exact **$1.23M** Thurs opening.  Sadly, Friday was not up to par as that day was running too hot as actuals came in below my **$5.05M** prediction for my **$6.28M** Thurs+Fri guesstimate to be a bit too optimistic, Lqstly, **Back to Black** was truly the runt of the weekend whose actuals went under both my **$.61M** Thurs and **$.98** Fri estimate for a truly disastrous opening that could not reach my **$1.84M** Pre+Thurs+Fri expectation.  While IF is a great sign of confidence for big, original storytelling, Paramount might be regretting that **$110M** budget,  At least, The Strangers has already recouped its **$8.5M** price-tag, setting itself up for a financially successful trilogy.

Trying to kick-off what was originally the true start to the summer, studios are coming in with some hopeful big guns this Memorial Day weekend.  In an attempt to recreate the explosive WOM magic 9 years ago, George Miller and Warner Bros are returning to the Australian Wasteland with **Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.**  In 2015, Mad Max: Fury Road, while not a smash hit at the time, quickly became a cultural moment, generating a huge awards push and a large following of one of the best action films of all time.  While many films with growing online fandoms, such as Dune and Spiderverse, were able to break-out by the time the sequel arrived, Furiosa is in a difficult position where instead of continuing the story, it is taking a spin-off approach, where films like Lightyear have failed.  Still, with stellar visuals, WOM, and hype, there is enough hope for the film to not get stuck at a red light.  As a recent 2.5 hour PLF-driven epic, we will use **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** as a comp.  For the kids, Chris Pratt is lending his voice once again to another iconic role in **The Garfield Movie.**  While IF was able to grab some of that young audience, Garfield is here to conquer the full family demographic as it is the first animated feature in 2.5 months since Kung Fu Panda 4.  As an animated outing with a somewhat built in fanbase, we will use **Kung Fu Panda 4** as a comp.  I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

For Warners, it might not be such a lovely day.  Even though Furiosa's ticket sales had a healthy start, they sadly were not able to speed up during the week.  Instead, they come off as rather front-loaded.  At this rate, F:AMMS is racing towards a **$2.67M Thurs** opening compared to KotPotA.  While this is a just fine face value preview outing, given the reception and online hype of the prequel, this is looking to be a major disappointment.  Sadly, Friday is not only looking to be just as bad, but rather a complete standstill.  Sales were never able to pick up to emmulate a major blockbuster as F:AMMS is looking at a  **$5.77M Fri** compared to KotPotA.  Not really sure what is going on here.  Hopefully, the walk-ups are stronger than expected, but these numbers are rather concerning.  Even the theater capacities, which are not dreadful, certainly are smaller than expected for the potential blockbuster.  At least KotPotA showed encouraging signs of sales growth and demand, both that Furiosa are missing.  If the great word of mouth and lack of competition is any sign of hope these next two weeks, Furiosa looks like she will have a long road ahead of her to recover from this side attraction.

If there is one thing this orange tabby hates more than Mondays is audiences because not many people are showing up for the comic icon.  Despite being a name IP, ticket sales have been rather mute with little growth throughout the week until an extreme surge these final days.  Compared to KFP4, TGM is on track for a **$1.34M** **Thurs**.  **Things to Note:** There were **$.50M** of Early Screenings that will be counted later.  While Thursday is not a real drive for audiences on non-event animated title, this low number is still rather concerning.  Thankfully, Friday is looking to be a tad healthier with **$5.11M** compared to KFP4.  That's...better.  The good news is sales are really starting to increase in big groups so we can see a large amount of last minute families/parties.  With theater capacities either similar or even larger at Theater 1, there is a strong presence for family walk-ups throughout the holiday weekend.  This may not be the opening Sony once wanted, but this cat is not on his last life just yet.

Overall, this brings Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga to a **$8.44M** Th+Fri opening.  That can't be right.  Right??  While it does look like sales are under-indexing in this area, be warned, we are looking at an under-performer here.  For The Garfield Movie, we are looking at a less stressful **$6.95M** Pre+Th+Fri.  If these numbers hold, Furiosa is looking at a **$27M** 4-Day weekend.  Really disappointing if true, but I feel like we will at least see something higher.  Either way, the latest Mad Max entry is looking to stall towards its **$168M** budget.  For Garfield, if these numbers hold, we are looking at a **$24M** 4-Day weekend.  Up against a **$60M** pricetag**,** this is not terrible, but it is not the big animated return cinemas were expecting.  While I feel like these numbers will go up, there is a strong chance we are looking at one of the worst Memorial Day weekends in years.

I have taken some suggestions to help make this post better. Please comment if you have anymore!

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle**

- Flip (Looking at some theaters near me, Haikyu is outselling Spy x Family (May 20).)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.26M/$5.3M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $2.63M THU. All these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18 so that'll go down. Feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find good comps (May 19). Numbers are from last THU, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $5.30M EA+THU.)

- keysersoze123 (This will be a late bloomer. I am still expecting 50m+ OW (May 23).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $3.96M THU. Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- TwoMisfits (Aging male-skewing franchises tend to get the biggest bump from this deal. Folks are on the fence but know what they are getting. Female skewing non-sequel ones tend to get zero help.  You need baseline interest to get people willing to pay anything, b/c these still are $5.  The other effect of the deal is that movies releasing around the $5 hits sometimes get hurt. | June TMobile $5 Atom movie. This could help it go huge, like last year's Spider-Verse (May 22).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.2M THU. Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20). Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. Very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

- YM! (Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.10M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $3.86M THU. Not impressed at all so far here sadly (May 19). Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here (May 15).)

- AniNate (Finally a little movement here. 23 Thursday, 52 Fri-Sun (compared to 18 THU and 23 FRI-SUN on May 17) (May 22). Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 THU preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first THU at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the THU previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on THU for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder (Comp: $12.33M THU at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $6.21M THU. Early sales haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18). At 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (Chugging along at this point (May 19). Show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective, easily the biggest for any animated movie in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $7.74M THU.  10.0% Matinee sales, 5.3% 3D sales and 42.2% PLF sales. (May 19). Strange pre-sale pattern. Was there some sort of promo that dropped today?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (May 16). I do not have good comps, especially for D1.  5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Will it be as backloaded as Elemental?  It's tough to sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days, so perhaps not.  But it does show how backloaded purely kids animation is. Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales. Of presales, 3.5% are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the SAT of release weekend (NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost OW slightly depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $8.97M THU. Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18). This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for THU (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for THU (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for THU at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base THU rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.5M THU. I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19). No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of PLFs, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the PLFs (May 15).)

- YM! (Did some snooping around for the Funko Event as I was curious if perhaps families getting presales for the opening Saturday vs opening Thursday as those sales are kind of weak Thursday and uhm it‚Äôs at 250 tickets. Which is like 5 times Garfield‚Äôs EA showing of 50 tickets all at PLF prices despite normal theaters. Most of which at 9:30 AM with only one theater having it at 11:00 AM (May 22). Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M THU comp and $22.2M FRI comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True FRI although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the THU average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount TUES so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20). Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event. Pretty solid for what it is. Majestic is healthy and about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn (May 17). Only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a THU . It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp: $31.07M**

- AMC (""Some 200,000 movie fans have bought their AMC tickets already. This is more Day 1 ticket sales at AMC than for any other R-rated movie ever."" Insiders tell The Hollywood Reporter that first-day sales are likely around $8 million to $9 million if extrapolating the 200,000 stat cited by Aron (May 22).)

- DEADLINE (Already heating up eight weeks before its debut, having already collected some $8M in first day ticket sales. $8M is pretty remarkable for an R-rated movie two months before release. While there are no direct comps on Deadpool & Wolverine ticket sales in post-Covid history, its current cash bests the 24-hour advance ticket sales of The Batman ($6.5M), Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($6M) and John Wick: Chapter 4 ($1.4M). The Batman and GOTG3 opened to respective 3-day weekends of $134M and $118.4M (May 22).)

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. Best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M THU. Pretty damn great day 2!(May 21).)

- AniNate (THU sales still largely biased towards primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not enough for people to take off work early. | Good lord already 80+ THU previews sold for Deadpool at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! Already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $30.03M THU. Looking at keysersoze123's MTC1 data: These are incredible (May 22). $40.22M THU (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $23.98M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $31.04M/$38.62M/$40.21M/$22.35M (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver THU: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- keysersoze123 (1st few days of PS is all about fanboys so T-x does not matter. By this FRI it will be in steady state mode. With this long a cycle that would be at very low levels. | Looking at FRI sales, its IM will be closer to Thor 4 than BP2. So we can do the projections based on how the previews will go. However Its really early. Let us wait until we have T-x comps. Probably will have to wait until July to get credible comps. | MTC2 early sales tend to be way weaker for all movies. The disparity for big movies is even higher.  | Nothing out of ordinary in day 2 pace for MTC1 (May 22). Obvious skew on previews (compared to FRI) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19). Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish.  I wonder where Deadpool 3 will land. Anything is fine as long as it does pull in a Marvels (May 17).)

- Legion Again (Previews this early in summer are almost a THU opening, so Fri soemthing like +35-55% from Th is IM ~4.9-5.5. If we get some strong Fri sales when we‚Äôre close maybe I‚Äôll drag it up to 5.6 or something but it will be really really tough to beat that. Expecting an IM close to Thor 4. Better reception (in avg case, just by regression to the mean) but bigger previews/more fanrush element, ~cancelling. | [T-65 Projection Matrix ($166M-$186M OW)](https://forums.boxofficetheory.com/topic/31569-the-box-office-buzz-tracking-and-pre-sale-thread/?do=findComment&comment=4680041) (May 22).)

- Porthos (Comp: $21.38M THU. MCU/SW films tend to have a bit longer of a slope-down on the decent of the ""u-curve"" so I think I'll keep posting ""Day x"" comps for at least a couple more days (May 23). Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M THU Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20). | No comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close is Captain Marvel (T-58) and only other Disney release is TROS (T-59).  Longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi (~70 days). Longest major release since Fast X's 99 days.  Probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 days. Length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat. It's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS MON opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($150M locked imo.  Don‚Äôt really see under $30M for previews and a 6x multi gets it to $180M OW. With GOTG 3 early reception I think $200M becomes a real discussion (May 22). $44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. Sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M THU GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THU COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane. Has almost 200 more showings than Inside Out 2.  Sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). Also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and it's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark presale sets for DP3... 3 screens and 15 showings each - the PLF is giving 1 of 2 PLF screens and the non-PLF is doing some 3d showings. Not the set that a normal ""big"" Marvel movie gets, but it seems my 2 locals have taken a ""put up or shut up"" strategy for almost all blockbusters lately. This IS equal or more than most everything lately (although Bad Boys 4 is getting 3 screens and 14 showings at my PLF, so...). But, compared to 2019 Marvel, or even 2021 or EVEN 2023 Marvel...this is a low set (May 19).)

- vafrow (Comp: $41.8M THU. 8% growth at this stage is very positive. I expect another drop tomorrow, but I'm probably not going to touch this until the weekend at this stage. I'm comping high, and without a proper MCU comparison (Marvels doesn't count), it's hard to gauge, but I feel this is just doing really well here (May 22). 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards PLFs in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start. Definitely feels like we got a potential 25m previews/150m+ opener. Still don't buy 200m OW but am starting to see 30m previews/175m+ OW as a strong possibility. | On its first day has sold over 10x Furiosa T-6 here in SE Wisconsin. At North Shore, 70% of Shang-Chi‚Äôs and Venom 2‚Äôs T-2, 47% of Homecoming‚Äôs T-2, and 41.25% of Thor: Ragnar√∂k‚Äôs T-2 - just using DP&W‚Äôs T-66! | At half of Furiosa‚Äôs T-4 sales here in the past ten minutes in just two of the theaters PLF shows (May 20). 42 showings for previews across four SE Wisconsin theaters I track. ~20% more showings than IO2 and about the same amount of PLFs spread. Likely 3-4 screens a theater for THU previews, but has SuperScreen + 2 UltraScreen screens in Majestic Cinema. Seems to be a 3D push with North Shore having primetime showings in 3D UltraScreen (May 19).)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Furiosa Average Thursday Comp/Prediction *assuming $3.5M for crazymoviekid, $5M for el sid, $4.4M for keysersoze123, and $4M for YM!*: $3.99M/$4.09M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $4.59M THU. Removed Apes as a comp because I didn't track EA on its T-0 and also because it seems walk-ups will be the opposite story. So while the average doesn't tell the whole story, it still dropped significantly against every comp. The MTC1 over-index is crazy too. Based on pace, I will go with a final prediction of $4.3 Million, +/- 0.3 (May 22). Down against every comp. Highly overindexing in MTC1 and Alamo (only 28% sold in other chains is pretty low). Most comparable to... BoSS, which is (not) coincidentally the lowest comp value I have. Right now with this pace and thinking about those variables I think $4.5-5 Million is a good target, but I will be looking closest at that comp moving forward (May 21). Still kickin it (May 20). Still doing quite well here (May 19). GxK really propping the average up but for now I could see that settling at around $5 Million, still good pace! (May 12). Really good stuff in this market (May 9).)

- AniNate (Might be copium but Saturday presales being significantly higher than Friday gives me hope of a certain casual interest (May 22). Encouraging to see the weekend fill out a bit. Been seeing a lot of promotion during the basketball playoffs so general awareness has to be getting there now. (May 15). Skimmed through Thur/Fri and Valley View (Cleveland vicinity) has sold roughly 60 Furiosa tix so far while Tinseltown (Canton) has sold 40. I'm guessing the upfront audience does lean more toward the urban/cosmopolitan sensibilities (May 9).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $2.76M THU | $5.96M FRI | $6.15M FRI 3-Day Pace. I think Furiosa gonna end well below 4. Something like 3.75M. Awful trending and MTC1 overindexing (May 22). Will underindex here but MEH sales. No improvement either with comps dropping (May 22).)

- crazymoviekid (Comp: $2.80M THU | $4.61M FRI. Pretty steep drop, looking more like $3M-$4M Thursday. Somehow still very mute for Friday. No way, but these FRI comps are giving $5M (May 22). Decent day for THU since comps either ticked up or are level. Feeling $4M-$5.5M THU. Rather mute start for FRI (May 21). Best between $3.5M-$5M for now (May 20).)

- el sid (Comp: $8.3M THU. On MON it was still doing really fine in my theaters but be prepared that this number will go down because for the comparison films with less than 1k tickets it was way easier to have good jumps percentage-wise. Still, Apes and GxK comps can't go below 5M because Furiosa IS already in front. Overall I doubt that Furiosa's average numbers will be below 5M in my theaters tomorrow, its presales are already too high for that (May 22). Furiosa continues its strong performance in ""my"" theaters. The movie yesterday had already 1.310 sold tickets (for THU, May 23). Up 15% in ca. 24 hours which isn't bad at all after the first rush.  Already comfortably in front of The Fall Guy's final sales (it had 1.071 counted on THU for THU) and almost on par with Civil War's final sales (1.357) and also the Apes finally had not more than 1.657 sold tickets in my theaters (May 11). I also can't complain about Furiosa's presales in my theaters, not at all. Already 1,138 sold tickets (in all of ""my"" 7 theaters) for May 23. 14 days left. Promising start. Civil War on THU of the release week for THU had 1,357 sold tickets and The Fall Guy finally had 1,071 sold tickets (May 9).)

- Inceptionzq (Denver Comp: $3.40M THU. Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $4.53M/$6.17M/$6.40M/$4.76M. Emagine THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp: $2.19M/$2.64M/$2.92M/$1.75M.)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $3.94M THU.)

- keysersoze123 (Thinking 4.3/4.5m for Furiosa (May 22). Meh acceleration again. Furiosa looking finishing in 4.x at this point (May 21). Really meh increase. Could be the impact of Wolverine PS (May 20).  Accelerating at the right time (May 19). Definitely chugging along. I am feeling good about 5m+ previews (May 15). It has way stronger sales than Garfield and that is expected. I am thinking of 5m previews for now (May 14). I think this is a solid OD presales. With a short PS window its probably looking at 5m+ previews (May 9).)

- Porthos (Comp: $3.39M THU. WHELP!  Never a good sign when showtimes start disappearing the night before release (Only three, but still...). My RotB and Fall Guy comps both got boosted by EA, so keep that in mind. Still, none of the other comps improved all that much, so.... Yeah.  Sacto might just be under-performing.  But if not, 3.75m or so might be in the cards (May 23). If I had to bet, I'd bet on it doing over 4m, as I do think Sacto is either underperforming or I'm very likely using the wrong comps.  | Meh (May 22). Not exactly blasting down the doors here.  Could be late arriving crowd (see The Fall Guy comp with $4.41M), could be bad comps, could be under-performing here (May 21).)

- Rorschach (Comp: $3.97M THU | $9.21M FRI. Not an amazing finish, but not horrible either. Still believe it can reach $4 mil, but given the pessimistic turn-around on this film in the past couple days, I'm really not so sure anymore (May 23). THU is still holding strong. FRI collapsed a little bit against Apes, which enjoyed a huge bump the Wednesday before. A tad concerning (May 22). Holding up okay against Apes comps. Comps crept up just a bit from yesterday (May 21).)

- TalismanRing (Comp: $4.10M THU. NYC.)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $4.00M. Thinking it just barely gets to $4M previews. Going with $4M +/- $0.2M. Pretty solid recovery all things considering. Let's see how walkups go this evening (May 23). Just yikes. Not sure if this gets to $4M for Thursday (May 22). Yeah, idk this had a great pace up until Deadpool just sucked the air out of the room. Don't really know if $5M previews is happening anymore (May 21). Not impressed with pace to be honest (May 20). Does look like it's heading to maybe $5M (May 19). Second straight day of weak growth. Not a great sign (May 18). First meh day since presales started (May 17). Keeps climbing at a strong pace (May 11). This continues to grow at an excellent rate (May 10). Really strong day 2. The short presales is for sure a factor (May 9).)

- TwoMisfits (Final sets for Garfield and Furiosa were the same at my PLF and reg theater - 3 screens (with 1 PLF each) at the PLF and 3 screens at the non-PLF.  Plenty of room to do well this weekend if either can. PS - And they have acres of showings today.  The new Cinemark 2024 policy seems to be the clear out Thursday nights for openers, so they have almost as many showings today as Friday (May 23).)

- vafrow (Comp: $3.5M THU. This is a very weak finish. It didn't maintain pace with POTA, which I was hoping it might follow. At this stage, it's extremely IMAX heavy, but no showings over the course of the weekend are more than a third full, so there's zero rush factor to buy tickets. I don't think we're looking at bigger than normal walk ups or anything (May 23). Isn't bad for a property that should be more front loaded. I still think the POTA comp ($5.7M) is probably the best, and it's looking strong (May 22). Decent growth and slight bump up (May 21). Slipped slightly. Nothing too eventful. But we're still in holiday weekend more in Canada right now. Tomorrow might see a better bump (May 20). Losing pace. It might be the long weekend effect though, with this being a holiday weekend (May 19). A bit of a step back today (May 18). It's starting to heat up (May 17). Comps are showing as steady since the last update, but it dipped quite a bit this week before rebounding today. Advance ticket buying has been so off in this market recently for some reason. Holding pace with Apes is a good sign (May 16). It had a good day (May 12). Mediocre day 2 (May 10). Not the hottest start. IMAX is the format of choice so ATP will be high (May 9).)

- YM! (Southeast Wisconsin: Furiosa‚Äôs T-6 hours is 197 tickets across four theaters. Should match Napoleon‚Äôs 272 tickets that NS/MF had thirty minutes before showtime. Thinking around 3.5m-4.5m previews. Thinking Furiosa should do around 35m OW (May 23). Solid growth shown within the past two days although I do think Deadpool tickets slowed its sails. Currently at 68.4% (or 30% if we use just NS+MF) of Napoleon‚Äôs T-30 minutes before previews at North Shore and Menomonee Falls. Feeling a bit less optimistic considering the muted jumps and this is likely going to be last post on it due to work but thinking around 3.5-4.5m previews prediction (May 22). Solid growth shown within the past two days although I do think Deadpool tickets slowed its sails. Currently at 53.7% (or 21.7% if we use just NS+MF) of Napoleon‚Äôs T-30 minutes before previews at North Shore and Menomonee Falls. Not much has changed from my 4-5m previews prediction (May 21). Furiosa looking healthy from a quick and dirty glance. They‚Äôre trying a Parking Lot Cinema Drive In at Majestic in addition to 2 of the 3 PLFs. Healthy at Majestic and North Shore with 30-ish at primetime, very soft at Menominee and Brookfield Square with PLFs around 10-15 at primetime. The PLFs are slowly inching ground but should have a solid idea TUES. Still thinking 4-5M previews (May 20). Not much has changed. Pace is solid and growth is normal. Feel about right for the 4-5M previews range (May 19). Pretty solid I guess. Seems that most of it's business is in the Marcus Theaters in Mequon/Waukesha so not really expecting much a diverse showing but there seems to be a fanbase around it. Feel good in 4.5-5M previews range (May 17).)

**Hit Man**

- vafrow (For THU previews, only 2/5 theatres are playing it for previews (an additional is picking it up starting FRI), with only two tickets sold across the four showtimes. Taking a wider 50km radius (captures most of the Greater Toronto Area) gets 35 total tickets sold, with most being in the downtown locations (which also happens to be theatres where it probably played during TIFF). Playing in 11/26 theatres, with 26 showtimes. Not getting any marketing that I can see and really playing to cinephiles that have heard the word of mouth (hence the TIFF theatres doing better) (May 22). Getting a theatrical release up here in Canada, and early signs are that it might get a pretty decent screen count. Not super wide or anything, but a pretty decent amount for a weekend that has a lot of other releases (May 14).)

**The Garfield Movie EA Estimate: $0.57M**

**The Garfield Movie Thursday Comp/Prediction *assuming $1.55M for keysersoze123*: $1.23M/$1.38M**

- abracadabra1998 (Comp: $1.13M THU.  Rose against a few comps and kinda converging a little bit. I'll go with $1.2 Million, +/- 0.2. Maybe this will have stellar walk-ups, I sure hope it does, but I am not seeing it from pre-sales sadly (May 22). Gonna keep sounding the alarm bells. HORRIBLE update for this so close to release (May 21). I think people that are expecting this to break out like it seems like it is doing so overseas are in for a rude awakening come this weekend (May 20). This could have a good late surge since EA has been sucking away some pre-sales up until this morning, so let's see if this bounces up a little. Not impressed at all at this stage though, not seeing the break-out some are anticipating (May 19). The two comps that are most helpful, Wish and Trolls (not PLF, EA on a weekend, family movies) are both pointing to a lot lower than average, so I'm inclined to give those a lot more weight. I'm thinking $500-600k for EA (May 18). Still not really accelerating, and the EA is falling against comps (May 12). Good EA numbers, but many of these comps were PLF-only EA, which this is not, so I think the ATP will be quite lower and that should be adjusted for (May 9).)

- AniNate (IF seems to be holding its own in presales, 42 Friday compared to Garfield's 75. Imagine it's pulling a significant audience away (May 23). I am surprised presales have been so low in the suburban red county theater I've been looking at compared to IF (May 21). EA screenings are pretty filled to the brim here now for what that's worth. Maybe a surge in family demand will present itself later next week (May 17). EA sales look decent now, but this does feel rather weak compared to the IF presales. Not 100% certain what's going on here but based on this I buy the trades' opening estimates over the forum vibes (May 15). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Let me hop onto the doom train. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not looking good. I‚Äôm very much considering a sub 30m opening weekend. From all the theaters I have tracked, this movie has sold a whopping‚Ä¶ 246 tickets for Thursday previews. Compare that to the well over 750 tickets for Inside Out 2, and it‚Äôs pitiful. I hope the weekend proves me wrong and walkups are strong, but it‚Äôs not looking good (May 22).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Comp: $2.09M THU | $4.53M FRI. Decent THU sales but FRI remains POOR (May 23). Decent to Okay THU sales, Poor FRI sales (May 22). Would guess $500K EA based on MTC 2 (May 19).)

- crazymoviekid (Comp: $1.04M THU | $2.63M FRI. Fine day of sales, for THU but still not recovering. Looking between $1M-$1.5M THU. Much needed recovery day for FRI, still a long way to go. $3M-$4M FRI right now. (May 22). Pretty bad THU and FRI is pretty dreadful (May 21). Looking around $1.5M-$1.75M. Not stellar, but it's kid -driven animated. THU isn't a real rush (May 20).)

- el sid (Comp: $0.8M THU. The $0.8M comp is too low but I had no better and more comps. By the way, Garfield's Friday looked (way) better with 240 sold tickets compared to 173 on THU (IF had 421 sold tickets on Thursday for Thursday last week, Dolittle 395 back then). I don't think Garfield can reach these numbers but at least it will be a closer battle. I think it's still too early to panic because IF had also very muted sales and the acceleration did not start until early THU , at least in my theaters (May 22). Not much to see yet. There is some acceleration. So far I don't worry because things didn't start to look better for IF till early THU plus Garfield had EA shows and it is/was a holiday weekend (May 20).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Comp: $1.11M THU. Lightyear probably the best comp here size-wise for EA, probably ends around 750-800k (May 18).)

- keysersoze123 (Thinking 1.5/1.6m for Garfield (May 22). Meh acceleration again. Looks like finish 1.5m minus early shows (May 21). Really meh increase. Could be the impact of Deadpool (May 20). Still pacing similar to what I saw 2 days ago. Just awful number. Around what Trolls did late last year and that burned way more through its early shows which was like 12 days before its release (May 19). With it being just 1PM regular show on a SUN, it wont over index on MTC1 like early PLF shows for big movies. Probably around 400k ish for early shows. $500k possible if early shows are everywhere (May 19). 4 days later.  Almost no pace so far. SUN shows are near sellout and so limited growth. Previews are like 35% of Panda 4 and FRI is under 1/3rd. That said this will under index in MTC1 as Panda also did that. Still struggling to see this as a breakout. Looking at the current state, it looks like half of IF as well !!! Of course that had Reynolds and did not finish that great (May 17). Its definitely weaker than even Elemental. That said these movies tend to finish strong and so I am not writing it off so early. Just that the long PS window is irrelevant for them. They could start presales a week before release and it would be the same. | Meh. Wait until next week to gauge where its going to finish. Has very low ATP as well and actual would be even lower as its going to see tons of kids tickets (May 14). Early shows are regular digital shows at 1PM this SUN. So ATP will be very low. I think 500k ish at best. Previews let us see how things go in the final week. Presales are almost non existent (May 13).)

- Rorschach (Comp: $0.86M THU | $3.71M FRI. At this point, better hope for some big walk-up turnout (May 23). Bleh (May 21).)

- TheFlatLannister (Comp: $1.82M THU. Based on trend, I'll take under $1.8M for Thursday and think previews will be reported around $2M with EA (May 23). This is so bad. Sold 1/3 of what it did yesterday (May 22). oof steep drop today (May 21). Well, there's at least some sign of life (May 20). Pace is actually terrible (May 19). Not much movement at all in the past week. Probably heading to $2M+ (May 17).)

- TwoMisfits (Final sets for Garfield and Furiosa were the same at my PLF and reg theater - 3 screens (with 1 PLF each) at the PLF and 3 screens at the non-PLF.  Plenty of room to do well this weekend if either can. PS - And they have acres of showings today.  The new Cinemark 2024 policy seems to be the clear out Thursday nights for openers, so they have almost as many showings today as Friday (May 23).)

- vafrow (Comp: $0.7M THU. I did a quick count on Friday sales. While Thursday sales don't seem to have moved much from my morning count of 30, Friday sales are at 238. That's a pretty ridiculous ratio that we don't see often. There's maybe more potential here over the weekend. | That's a weak finish for something with a really low baseline. Last week, at least IF saw a good final surge. This failed to match that pace (May 23). Good news is that it's not far off from IF which had strong enough walk ups to be decent. But it's still not great. 20.2% of Paw Patrol 2. Canada was the only market with previews. I had to take an estimate of the data as I captured a bigger radius. If Paw Patrol could do well in September, there's really no excuse here (May 22). Even with a slight jump, this is miles behind a decent total (May 21). EA sales aren't bad, but previews are still extremely slow. This is clearly going to be a family weekend type film, but I'm surprised we're not seeing anything for previews yet (May 19). Comps don't paint a pretty picture though. EA shows are doing okay (May 11). May holiday in Canada is weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4).)

- YM! (Garfield feels like about 1.5-2M with EA for previews. Thinking Garfield around 25m OW (May 23). T-6 hours is at 39 tickets sold for Thursday and 89 including EA, therefore Garfield is at 34.5% of IF without EA, with EA it‚Äôs at 78.7% at about the same point in time. Friday and Saturday looks weak so it‚Äôll need good walkups. So yeah 1.8M-2M with EA is my guess (May 23). Amazing, Garfield sprinted from 35 tickets to a whopping 36 tickets. Still not that strong without EA but is at 75% of IF (T-6.5 hours until previews) and 34.4% of Wish‚Äôs North Shore+Menominee Total (T-30 minutes until previews) when you factor EA (26.3% of Wish, if we use the same theaters and include EA). Thinking about 1.5-2M Thursday previews including EA but am thinking 25m might be hit or miss with a good chance at O/U 20m (May 22). Finally moves tickets. Still not that strong without EA but at 75% of IF (T-6.5 hours until previews) and 34.4% of Wish‚Äôs North Shore+Menominee Total (T-30 minutes until previews) when you factor EA (26.3% of Wish, if we use the same theaters and include EA). Thinking 1.5-2.25m THU previews including EA but losing confidence in an OW above 30m (May 21). With EA, currently at 72 tickets (only 22 tickets are for THU). Not seeing any movement at any of the theaters, feels like it‚Äôs dead. Should get to a total similar to IF T-6 hours before opening but that‚Äôs mainly because of EA (May 20). Returns are common but apart from a decent EA showing, it feels really muted. Feels like with IF doing solid, it took some air out of Garfield. Thinking 1.8-2.25M THU previews range with EA. |  With less than twenty minutes to go, 50 tickets sold for EA. Thinking 500-600K for EA, so 2M previews total (May 18). Combined previews total for Garfield is 35 tickets with 23 tickets coming from EA, which is pretty solid. Still thinking 2-2.75m previews with EA as while not as widespread, the showings seem like they‚Äôre filling up nicely. Think it does about the same as IF though OW as due to the likely lower ATP and seemingly little screen space with no PLFs. | Meh, kids animation doesn't really make much notion until the MON for release and Garfield seems indicative of that. Thinking the 1.5-2M THU previews range folks were spitting out makes sense. Nothing screams breakout though and the fact it's getting one screen, maybe two at most for previews makes me feel like OW might be similar to IF (May 17).)

The Spanish-language musical crime comedy, starring Karla Sof√≠a Gasc√≥n, Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda√±a and √âdgar Ramirez, has been one of the buzziest projects to come to market in Cannes this year, with multiple U.S. distributors offering on the film since it premiered at the weekend. Netflix has swooped in for North American and UK rights to the original title in a deal that we‚Äôre hearing is in the high seven figures. The pact is in its closing stages.

The domestic number alone is in the high seven figures, which we understand to be a record domestic number for a foreign-language film. The streamer clearly believes in the movie and it‚Äôs conceivable it gets an awards push later this year, especially given that Netflix‚Äôs upcoming film slate lacks some of the obvious awards contenders of recent years.

Emilia P√©rez follows the story of Rita (Salda√±a), an overqualified and undervalued lawyer at a large firm that is more interested in getting criminals off the hook than bringing them to justice. One day, she is given an unexpected way out, when cartel leader Manitas (Gasc√≥n) hires her to help him withdraw from his business and realize a plan he has been secretly preparing for years: to become the woman he has always dreamt of being.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Civil War and Furiosa on June 7th, IF on June 15th, Inside Out 2 on June 21st and Despicable Me 4 on July 12th

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

'The Passion of The Christ' (2004) currently holds the record of highest grossing domestic for R-rated with $370 million.

Oppenheimer ($320 million), Joker ($335 million), Deadpool 2 ($324 million), and Deadpool ($363 million) tried and failed.

Based on the presales and the tracking done by Box Office Theory, Deadpool and Wolverine opening weekend of $150 million+ is yet but assured. 

Taking the floor of $150 million OW, that means DxW will need a multiplier of 2.6x to break the record.

As a comparison, Deadpool has 2.75x and Deadpool 2 has 2.54x

We know Deadpool and Wolverine won't beat Passion's adjusted record ($643 million), but Deadpool and Wolverine can definitely beat Passion's unadjusted record.",75,216

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June although given it has not yet been announced that will probably not happen for now. Might release later in June.

On the Japanese front Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

Movie with seemingly overinflated budget barely makes it back, not including marketing, and goes on streaming way sooner than expected. 

We know streaming doesn't really have a box office, so we can't say how much a movie ""makes"". But movies made just for streaming still get pretty high budgets and we don't see it as a 100% loss, it's simply what these platforms are willing to pay to keep subscribers. 

So, with something like the Fall Guy hitting streaming 2 weeks in, people are calling it a bomb and saying ""we all wait for streaming anyway"". It seems to me like *that's the plan*,  this is just what it's gonna be like and it'll be harder to measure financial successes from a BO point of view. Maybe these movies, including Fall Guy are just streaming films, and aren't really losing money, it's simply part of the marketing expenses. Or are studios really just releasing bomb after bomb and ""over inflating"" budgets for every movie for no reason?  ",50,80

While I agree the success of this individual movie won‚Äôt really help movies like Captain America 4 and Thunderbolts, what about Secret Wars? 

This movie seems like it will help set the stage for Secret Wars, and if both Deadpool and Wolverine return in it after leading a $1 billion movie, and we also get other icons returning like Downey, Evans, Stewart, Maguire, and Garfield, etc, would their combined presence, along with the Avengers franchise still being way bigger than Deadpool, be enough to ensure a good chance at $2 billion?

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the two films for the week.

#**Kinds of Kindness**

The film is directed by Yorgos Lanthimos (*Poor Things*, *The Favourite* and *The Lobster*) from a screenplay he co-wrote with Efthimis Filippou. The film stars Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, Mamoudou Athie, and Hunter Schafer. The film is described as a ""triptych fable"", and consists of three distinct but loosely connected stories.

#**The Bikeriders**

The film is written and directed by Jeff Nichols (*Take Shelter*, *Mud*, *Midnight Special* and *Loving*), and stars Jodie Comer, Austin Butler, Tom Hardy, Michael Shannon, Mike Faist, and Norman Reedus.. It tells a fictional story inspired by the 1967 photo-book of the same name by Danny Lyon depicting the lives of the Outlaws MC, a Chicago-based motorcycle gang.

Now that you've met this week's new releases. Let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- The two collaborations between Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone have produced great results for arthouse dramas; *The Favourite* made $95 million while *Poor Things* earned $117 million. It's got a very recognizable cast joining as well. It already premiered in Cannes, where it had a favorable response. Searchlight also kept the budget low at $15 million. 

- Biker gang films are rarely explored, and with a very recognizable cast, perhaps the audience would be interested in a small-scale drama. Nichols is also a sign of the quality, and the film currently has some great reviews.

#**CONS**

- *Kinds of Kindness* is an anthology film, which is a genre that has not been very popular in theaters. The last notable success of the genre was *Sin City*, which not only is 19 years old, but its sequel flopped years later. And while we mentioned it had a favorable response from Cannes, it's not exactly hailed as a fantastic film (6.6 average rating on RT and 71 on Metacritic suggests solid but not spectacular). And the reviews confirm the film is not as accessible as *Poor Things* or *The Favourite*.

- Biker gang films aren't popular in theaters. There hasn't been much success in that genre since *Wild Hogs* back in 2007, and that was a much more accessible comedy starring bigger box office draws. While the cast is recognizable, none are proven box office draws by themselves, despite Butler's rise in the past few years. And while Nichols is a symbol of quality, nearly all of his films are box office failures (with *Mud* being his sole success and the only one above $30 million). It needs to over-perform to recoup its $40 million budget.

And here's the past results.

Can it do it?

My prediction is $130M DOM and $100M INT. For a total gross of around $230M-$250M WW. If it has good WOM it could reach 300M. 

However, Universal is known for announcing the digital release of their theatrical movies way in advance, so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if people waited on it to hit PVOD.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Furiosa Average Thursday Comp *assuming $4.5M for keysersoze123*: $4.10M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.41M Thursday comp. Down against every comp. Highly overindexing in MTC1 and Alamo (only 28% sold in other chains is pretty low). That is most comparable to... BoSS, which is (not) coincidentally the lowest comp value I have. Right now with this pace and thinking about those variables I think $4.5-5 Million is a good target, but I will be looking closest at that comp moving forward (May 21). Still kickin it (May 20). Still doing quite well here (May 19). GxK obviously really propping the average up but for now I could see that settling at around $5 Million, still good pace! (May 12). Really good stuff in this market (May 9). Reallyyyyyy good day 1 here. I want to note that: NO I do NOT think preview numbers will be that high; it's just highlighting the fact that this is likely a movie that will be running hot in my market, as cinephile blockbusters usually do. Next update I will have T-14 comps, which will be a lot lower due to the short release window (May 8).)

- AniNate (Encouraging to see the weekend fill out a bit. Been seeing a lot of promotion during the basketball playoffs so general awareness has to be getting there now. (May 15). Skimmed through Thur/Fri and Valley View (Cleveland vicinity) has sold roughly 60 Furiosa tix so far while Tinseltown (Canton) has sold 40. I'm guessing the upfront audience does lean more toward the urban/cosmopolitan sensibilities (May 9). Presales show there's definitely some hype for this. Regal gonna irritate trackers again, offering no upcharge IMAX for Furiosa (May 8).)

- Charlie Jatinder ($3.05M Thursday comp.)

- crazymoviekid ($3.36M Thursday comp and $5.48M Friday comp. Decent day for Thursday since comps either ticked up or are level. Feeling $4M-$5.5M Thursday. Rather mute start for Friday (May 21). Best between $3.5M-$5M for now (May 20).)

- el sid ($5.8M average Thursday comp (without Exorcist 2) (May 12). Furiosa continues its strong performance in ""my"" theaters. The movie yesterday had already 1.310 sold tickets (for Thursday, May 23). Up 15% in ca. 24 hours which isn't bad at all after the first rush.  Already comfortably in front of The Fall Guy's final sales (it had 1.071 counted on Thursday for Thursday) and almost on par with Civil War's final sales (1.357) and also the Apes finally had not more than 1.657 sold tickets in my theaters (May 11). I also can't complain about Furiosa's presales in my theaters, not at all. Already 1,138 sold tickets (in all of ""my"" 7 theaters) for May 23. 14 days left. Promising start. Civil War on Thursday of the release week for Thursday had 1,357 sold tickets and The Fall Guy finally had 1,071 sold tickets (May 9).)

- Inceptionzq ($3.73M Denver Thursday comp. $5.13M/$9.62M/$10.61M/$8.18M Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp. $2.48M/$3.10M/$4.02M/$2.44M Emagine THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.94M Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Meh acceleration again. Furiosa looking finishing in 4.x at this point (May 21). Really meh increase. Could be the impact of Wolverine PS (May 20).  Accelerating at the right time (May 19). Definitely chugging along. I am feeling good about 5m+ previews (May 15). It has way stronger sales than Garfield and that is expected. I am thinking of 5m previews for now (May 14). I think this is a solid OD presales. With a short PS window its probably looking at 5m+ previews (May 9).)

- Porthos ($3.57M Thursday comp. Meh (May 22). Not exactly blasting down the doors here.  Could be late arriving crowd (see The Fall Guy comp with $4.41M), could be bad comps, could be under-performing here (May 21).)

- Rorschach ($4.24M Thursday comp and $10.67M Friday comp. Holding up okay against Apes comps. Comps crept up just a bit from yesterday (May 21).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.60M Thursday comp. Yeah, idk this had a great pace up until Deadpool x Wolverine just sucked the air out of the room. Don't really know if $5M previews is happening anymore (May 21). Not impressed with pace to be honest (May 20). Does look like it's heading to maybe $5M (May 19). Second straight day of weak growth. Not a great sign (May 18). First meh day since presales started (May 17). Keeps climbing at a strong pace (May 11). This continues to grow at an excellent rate (May 10). Really strong day 2. The short presales is for sure a factor (May 9). Not seeing much of a breakout. Still pretty solid start to presales (May 8).)

- vafrow ($3.5M Thursday comp. Isn't bad for a property that should be more front loaded. I still think the POTA comp ($5.7M) is probably the best, and it's looking strong (May 22). Decent growth and slight bump up (May 21). Slipped slightly. Nothing too eventful. But we're still in holiday weekend more in Canada right now. Tomorrow might see a better bump (May 20). It's losing pace. It might be the long weekend effect though, with this being a holiday weekend (May 19). A bit of a step back today (May 18). It's starting to heat up (May 17). Comps are showing as steady since the last update, but it actually dipped quite a bit this week before rebounding today. Advance ticket buying has been so off in this market recently for some reason. Holding pace with Apes is a good sign (May 16). It had a good day (May 12). Mediocre day 2 (May 10). Not the hottest start. IMAX is the format of choice though, so, ATP will be high (May 9).)

- YM! (Southeast Wisconsin: Solid growth shown within the past two days although I do think Deadpool tickets slowed its sails. Currently at 53.7% (or 21.7% if we use just NS+MF) of Napoleon‚Äôs T-30 minutes before previews at North Shore and Menomonee Falls. Not much has changed from my 4-5m previews prediction (May 21). Furiosa looking healthy from a quick and dirty glance. They‚Äôre trying a Parking Lot Cinema Drive In at Majestic in addition to 2 of the 3 PLFs. Healthy at Majestic and North Shore with 30-ish at primetime, very soft at Menominee and Brookfield Square with PLFs around 10-15 at primetime. The PLFs are slowly inching ground but should have a solid idea Tuesday. Still thinking 4-5M previews (May 20). Not much has changed. Pace is solid and growth is normal. Feel about right for the 4-5M previews range (May 19). Pretty solid I guess for Furiosa. Seems that most of it's business is in the Marcus Theaters in Mequon/Waukesha so not really expecting much a diverse showing but there seems to be a fanbase around it. Feel good in everyone's 4.5-5M previews range (May 17).)

**Hit Man**

- vafrow (Getting a theatrical release up here in Canada, and early signs are that it might get a pretty decent screen count. Not super wide or anything, but a pretty decent amount for a weekend that has a lot of other releases (May 14).)

**The Garfield Movie EA Estimate and Thursday Comp *assuming $1.5M for keysersoze123*: $0.57M and $1.23M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.05M Thursday comp.  Gonna keep sounding the alarm bells. HORRIBLE update for this so close to release (May 21). I think people that are expecting this to break out like it seems like it is doing so overseas are in for a rude awakening come this weekend (May 20). This could have a good late surge since EA has been sucking away some pre-sales up until this morning, so let's see if this bounces up a little. Not impressed at all at this stage though, not seeing the break-out some are anticipating (May 19). The two comps that are most helpful, Wish and Trolls (not PLF, EA on a weekend, family movies) are both pointing to a lot lower than average, so I'm inclined to give those a lot more weight. I'm thinking $500-600k for EA (May 18). Still not really accelerating, and the EA is falling against comps (May 12). Good EA numbers, but many of these comps were PLF-only EA, which this is not, so I think the ATP will be quite lower and that should be adjusted for (May 9).)

- AniNate (I am surprised presales have been so low in the suburban red county theater I've been looking at compared to IF (May 21). EA screenings are pretty filled to the brim here now for what that's worth. Maybe a surge in family demand will present itself later next week (May 17). EA sales look decent now, but this does feel rather weak compared to the IF presales. Not 100% certain what's going on here but based on this I buy the trades' opening estimates over the forum vibes (May 15). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11).)

- Charlie Jatinder (Would guess $500K EA based on MTC 2 (May 19).)

- crazymoviekid ($0.98M Thursday comp and $1.19M Friday comp. Pretty bad Thursday and Friday is pretty dreadful (May 21). Looking around $1.5M-$1.75M. Not stellar, but it's kid -driven animated. Thursday isn't a real rush (May 20).)

- el sid ($1.2M Thursday comp. Not much to see yet. There is some acceleration. So far I don't worry because things didn't start to look better for IF till early Thursday plus Garfield had EA shows and it is/was a holiday weekend (May 20).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.11M Thursday comp. Lightyear probably the best comp here size-wise for Early Access, probably ends around 750-800k (May 18).)

- keysersoze123 (Meh acceleration again. Looks like finish like 1.5m minus early shows (May 21). Really meh increase. Could be the impact of Wolverine PS (May 20). Still pacing similar to what I saw 2 days ago. Just awful number. Around what Trolls did late last year and that burned way more through its early shows which was like 12 days before its release (May 19). With it being just 1PM regular show on a Sunday, it wont over index on MTC1 like early PLF shows for big movies. Probably around 400k ish for early shows. $500k possible if early shows are everywhere (May 19). 4 days later.  Almost no pace so far. Sunday shows are near sellout and so limited growth. Previews are like 35% of Panda 4 and Friday is under 1/3rd. That said this will under index in MTC1 as Panda also did that. Still struggling to see this as a breakout. Looking at the current state, it looks like half of IF as well !!! Of course that had Reynolds and did not finish that great (May 17). Its definitely weaker than even Elemental. That said these movies tend to finish strong and so I am not writing it off so early. Just that the long PS window is irrelevant for them. They could start presales a week before release and it would be the same. | Meh. Wait until next week to gauge where its going to finish. Has very low ATP as well and actual would be even lower as its going to see tons of kids tickets (May 14). Early shows are regular digital shows at 1PM this sunday. So ATP will be very low. I think 500k ish at best. Previews let us see how things go in the final week. Presales are almost non existent (May 13).)

- Rorschach ($1.14M Thursday comp and $5.26M Friday comp. Bleh (May 21).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.05M Thursday comp. oof steep drop today (May 21). Well, there's at least some sign of life (May 20). Pace is actually terrible (May 19). Not much movement at all in the past week. Probably heading to $2M+ (May 17).)

- vafrow ($0.8M Thursday comp. Good news is that it's not far off from IF which had strong enough walk ups to be decent. But it's still not great. 20.2% of Paw Patrol 2. Canada was the only market with previews. I had to take an estimate of the data as I captured a bigger radius. If Paw Patrol could do well in September, there's really no excuse here (May 22). Even with a slight jump, this is miles behind a decent total (May 21). EA sales aren't bad, but previews are still extremely slow. This is clearly going to be a family weekend type film, but I'm surprised we're not seeing anything for previews yet (May 19). Comps don't paint a pretty picture though. EA shows are doing okay (May 11). It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4).)

- YM! (Finally moves tickets. Still not that strong without EA but at 75% of IF (T-6.5 hours until previews) and 34.4% of Wish‚Äôs North Shore+Menominee Total (T-30 minutes until previews) when you factor EA (26.3% of Wish, if we use the same theaters and include EA). Thinking 1.5-2.25m Thursday previews including EA but losing confidence in an OW above 30m (May 21). With EA it‚Äôs currently at 72 tickets (however only 22 tickets are for Thursday). Not seeing any movement at any of the theaters, feels like it‚Äôs dead. It should get to a total similar to IF T-6 hours before opening (so idk like Thursday at 6:00 AM) but that‚Äôs mainly because of EA (May 20). Returns are common but apart from a decent EA showing, it feels really muted. Feels like with IF doing solid, it took some air out of Garfield but maybe reviews and a strong last week push Garfield could turn it around but not feeling it rn. Thinking 1.8-2.25M Thursday previews range with EA. |  With less than twenty minutes to go, 50 tickets were sold for EA. Thinking 500-600K for EA, so 2M previews total (May 18). Combined previews total for Garfield is 35 tickets with 23 tickets coming from EA, which is pretty solid. Still thinking 2-2.75m previews with EA as while not as widespread, the showings seem like they‚Äôre filling up nicely. Think it does about the same as IF though OW as due to the likely lower ATP and seemingly little screen space with no PLFs. | Meh, kids animation doesn't really make much notion until the Monday for release and Garfield seems indicative of that. Thinking the 1.5-2M Thursday previews range folks were spitting out makes sense. Nothing screams breakout though and the fact it's getting one screen, maybe two at most for previews makes me feel like OW might be similar to IF (May 17).)

**Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle**

- Flip (Looking at some theaters near me, Haikyu is outselling Spy x Family (May 20).)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Average Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.26M/$5.3M**

- abracadabra1998 ($2.63M Thursday comp. All of these comps had been on sale for longer, so those will go up, with the exception of Civil War, which went on sale at T-18, so that'll go down. This feels like a walk-up movie so it's hard to find some good comps here (May 19). These numbers are from last Thursday, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.30M EA+Thursday comp.)

- TheFlatLannister ($3.96M Thursday comp. Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- YM! (Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

- vafrow ($3.2M Thursday comp. Nothing of note here. Staying steady. Will probably pick up only in the final week (May 20). Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. There's very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.15M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.86M Thursday comp. Not impressed at all with the numbers so far here sadly (May 19). Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here sadly, but we shall see where it goes (May 15).)

- AniNate (Safe to say the fan rush has ended, and it might not be immediately on casual family and radar when they're making memorial Day plans and there are two other kids movies out or about to be out (May 19).It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 Thursday preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first Thursday at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Out of the 4 tracked theaters, there is at least 774 tickets sold out of 1000+ seats. Blown Garfield out of the water (~200 tickets from the theaters I tracked). At least 3 sold out (or close to sold out) showings for Inside Out 2. Looking good for Inside Out 2. Of course this might just be fan surge and all. | I was looking at the Thursday previews in a theater near me. There is an almost completely sold out showing. Out of 195 seats, 175 were sold. Where I live there seems to be real interest. I counted about more than 400 tickets sold on Thursday for theaters near me, kind of shocked me (May 19).)

- charlie Jatinder ($12.33M Thursday comp at MTC2. Moving along nicely (May 21).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($6.21M Thursday comp. Early sales just haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18). Already at 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  For comparison, Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (Just chugging along at this point (May 19). At least the show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Too early to judge presales as ticket sales just started early this morning. Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective its way bigger than all animation movies seen recently including Panda 4. Easily the biggest I have seen in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (BAD COMPS: $8.02M Thursday comp.  10.0% Matinee sales, 5.3% 3D sales and 42.2% PLF sales. (May 19). Strange pre-sale pattern. Was there some sort of promo that dropped today?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (May 16). I do not have good comps for this movie.  Especially for D1.   IO2 = 5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Now will Inside Out 2 be as backloaded as Elemental?  Well it's tough to literally sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days that Elemental did, so perhaps not.  But it does show how backloaded purely kids animation is. Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales. 3.5% of presales are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the Saturday of release weekend (ie NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost the OW slightly, depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister ($8.97M Thursday comp. Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18). This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for Thursday (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for Thursday (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for Thursday at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base Thursday rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow ($3.5M Thursday comp. I'm surprised this hasn't been stronger. At this stage, I don't expect we'll see much activity until final week (May 19). No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of premium formats, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the premium formats (May 15).)

- YM! (Based on keysoze123's Elemental, Wish, Little Mermaid, and Kung Fu Panda 4 preview data, $5.66M Thursday comp and $22.2M Friday comp. Not a fan of the average comp (Disney has underperformed at MTC2 so not within history to rely on it overperforming like KFP4 and IF) but really like the True Friday although it is very inconsistent.  Not sure if IO2 would jump that high from the Thursday average. However, there‚Äôs a lot of variable since: 1. TLM should skew more towards young adults than families by nature which should make ATP higher. 2. IO2 should and does have a higher ATP than either Wish, KFP4 or Elemental due to total PLF control and presumably skews a bit older. 3. Wish was on Discount Tuesday so that should muddy up the comparisons. 4. The comparisons apart from Elemental are either days before or days behind. 5. Both Wish and KFP4 opened outside the summer season so internal multiplier will be different (especially with Wish‚Äôs five day) due to how summer and fall have entirely different natures in walkups which leaves just TLM/Elemental as viable comparisons. It does show that IO2 should at least open above 65m? (May 20). Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event. Pretty solid for what it is. Majestic is healthy and about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn (May 17). Only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a Thursday. It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

**Deadpool and Wolverine Average Thursday Comp: $33.05M**

- FANDANGO (Broke Fandango‚Äôs best first-day ticket sales record for 2024. The film is also the best first-day pre-seller from the Deadpool franchise (May 21).)

- abracadabra1998 (Day 1/2 Comps (not serious ones): $25.82M/$28.14M Thursday comp. Pretty damn great day 2!(May 21).)

- AniNate (Thursday sales are still largely biased towards the primetime evening showings. There may be FOMO but not quite enough for people to take off work early for it apparently. | Good lord already 80+ Thursday previews sold for Deadwolv at Canton (May 20).)

- AnthonyJPHer (Off to a hot start! At my theater in my town, there has been 8 tickets sold. That sounds low but it‚Äôs actually a lot, especially this far out and because Inside Out 2 hasn‚Äôt sold any tickets at my theater yet. Overall, looking more broadly at 4 theaters I track other than my own, there is a mind- boggling 1,029 tickets sold! This is already more than Inside Out 2 (May 20).)

- Charlie Jatinder ($40.22M Thursday comp (MCU first day sales). Amazing day two at MiniTC2. Well ahead of BP2, GOTG3 and AM3. Not too far off from Thor 4. This is more impressive considering they all were ~25-35 days out while this is 65 days out. | MTC2 has lower ATP generally due to smaller screens, less PLF, and more family friendly chain.  Does much better PTA than MTC1 (May 21). MCU MTC 1 24 Hours: Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness ~ 210K (T-29), Thor 4 ~ 137K (T-24), DP&W ~ 120K+ (T-66), BP 2 ~ 110K (T-38), AM3 ~ 88K (T-30), and GoTG3 ~ 76K (T-30). At T-30 guess DP&W would have been around 160-170K type. | Will mostly be above BP2 and below Thor 4. 3.6k so far. BP2 final was 4.6k. | It‚Äôs done (crossed GOTG3 day one sales). | Almost crossed GoTG3 day one sales at MiniTC2 (May 20).)

- Inceptionzq ($24.88M Denver Thursday comp. $30.99M/$38.19M/$40.06M/$21.92M Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comp (May 21). Drafthouse THU/FRI/SAT/SUN comps with L&T 24 hours and MoM 11 hours: (1.03x|0.968x) / (0.884x|0.945x) / (0.912x|1.01x) / (0.561x|1.004x). | Denver Thursday: In like for like theaters: (0.828x Thor L&T First 24 hours) and (0.628x Doctor Strange MoM first 11.5 hours) (May 20).)

- keysersoze123 (Obvious skew on previews (compared to Friday) as its 9+ weeks from release. | Excellent growth even past 2:15 PM. Finished ahead of BP2 and ~20K below Thor 4 (116k for DxW and FINAL The Marvels previews at 133k). It has the longer cycle. This includes fan shows which sold 18K+ in initial check around noon PST.  | Fan event is just MTC1. I dont see anything for any other MTC so far or smaller chains. | I think at this point we need to comp with 2022 MCU movies if OD presales are on par.  Until we are within T-x cycle for this movie, we cannot comp after 1st 2-3 days. | Fan shows are yuge. Adding FanShows and Previews should put it between BP2 and Thor 4 for now. Terrific OD. | Over time, GotG3 should provide great comps. I can say for sure, its no where in the ballpark of DS2 which did 36m previews.  | Really good start. Should finish the day ahead of Ant 3 I think. Sales will taper off after fanboy rush. This does not include fan shows. | No full data yet but show counts for previews (MTC1 - 7427 and MTC2 - 2914). MTC1 shows they are ready for big numbers. MTC2 is more conservative and numbers will go up close to release. If I have to guess based on really early indications, its OD between Guardians 3 and Ant 3 at MTC1. MTC2 I unfortunately cannot get data (May 20).  Thor 4 is the most logical comp but that had meh WOM so IM was terrible. Previews were excellent though. Since its previews was 3 days after July 4, its final surge was stronger than even DS2. I dont think there is any difference between early and late July. All schools/colleges will still be off (May 19). Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish.  I wonder where Deadpool 3 will land. Anything is fine as long as it does pull in a Marvels (May 17).)

- Porthos ($21.65M Thursday comp. Pretty standard Day 2, really.  Best sign, I think, is it nearly matching BP2 (that also had a long pre-sale window starting at T-38) (May 22). $22.09M Thursday Day 1 Comps (8.4% 3D and 58.5% PLF) (May 21). Pretty good, all things considered.  BP2 and onward tell a pretty consistent picture.  Do think the extra month of pre-sales is gonna mess with these comps at least a little (May 21). | Since setup took 60-75 min longer, take the following with a slight grain of salt: 1:45 PM with 2,105 tickets sold.  (NWH 2am: 6515),  (NWH 2pm: 10685), (Batman 12:45 pm: 1693), (MoM 1:00 pm: 5030), (L&T 12:15pm: 2519), (BP2 2:15pm: 2197) and (GOTG3 12:40pm: 1317). Two theaters have not yet checked in.  Seems to be broadly in line with other markets that have reported in (May 20). | No point of comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close was Captain Marvel (T-58 start date).  Only other Disney release is TROS starting at T-59.  Gonna be the longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi (which looks to be ~70 days). Longest major release of any studio since Fast X's 99 days.  Probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 days. Length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat. It's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

- TalismanRing (NYC Regal Local. 17 shows (3 3D, 3 RPX, 11 Reg 2): 102 tickets sold for first hour - almost half for the 7pm RPX showing. COMPS Monday opening week: Marvels: 91 (11pm), Eternals: 266 (7pm), Black Widow: 239 (5pm), and Venom 2: 131 (6pm) (May 20).)

- TheFlatLannister ($44.36M Dune 2 Day 2 comp. Pretty ridiculously strong day 2. It sold more tickets on T-65 than Dune 2 did in its final day of presales. | $22.42M Thursday GOTG3 Comp.  Considering this thing is 60+ days out, I'd say day 2 was amazing (May 21). Sold around 1k tickets in the last 8 hours. Keep in mind this is not T-X so once I switch to T-X 30+ days from now, comp will probably be well over $30M for GOTG. Thinking ~8k seats sold by T-30 for ~$37M comp with GOTG vol 3. | DON'T TAKE THESE THURSDAY COMPS (Dune+APES+GxK) SERIOUSLY: $46.33M. Rollout is pretty insane as well. It has almost 200 more showings than Inside out 2. Crazy, but true. It's sold more tickets than Dune 2 did as of T-1 (Dune 2 finished with 13.6k on T-0). It has also surpassed Godzilla tickets sold as of T-0. | Half way finished collecting data on Deadpool for Florida and: It's nearly tripled Dune 2 first 24 hours of sales and data is still flowing in. | Passed GOTG3, ATSV, Dune 2 (First 24 hours) in about 3 hours. I think we can put the under $100M OW discussion to bed. To the shock of no one, this is blowing up. First 24 hours update should have average comps near $35M (May 20).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark presale sets for DP3... 3 screens and 15 showings each - the PLF is giving 1 of 2 PLF screens and the non-PLF is doing some 3d showings. Not the set that a normal ""big"" Marvel movie gets, but it seems my 2 locals have taken a ""put up or shut up"" strategy for almost all blockbusters lately. This IS equal or more than most everything lately (although Bad Boys 4 is getting 3 screens and 14 showings at my PLF, so...). But, compared to 2019 Marvel, or even 2021 or EVEN 2023 Marvel...this is a low set (May 19).)

- vafrow ($41.1M Thursday comp. 20% growth on day 2 when it had a really strong first day is impressive. Ahead of T-1 for Dune Previews to officially be the highest selling film I've tracked since I switched to the 5 theatre radius (May 21). MTC4 has really jacked up plf prices in the last year or so, and D&W is skewed heavily towards premium formats in my track. I'm not sure how many trackers are doing price adjustments, but lack of good MCU comps in the last year could see a big price impact. Watching L&T comps in particular because being a rare adult skewing July MCU film seems to be the most ideal (May 21). Solid jump over the course of the day. Dolby sales jumped up the most, potentially as good IMAX screens got taken. | Not sure what happened for the East coast this morning, but sales seemed to have rebounded. A little hit and miss in different markets, but that's what I'd assume for that region. There's some small communities. Not sure why it took so long for sales to hit when southern Ontario was hot off the mark. People may have assumed 9:00 am eastern time. | Numbers pulled around 11:00 am, so two hours worth of data. Chain is pushing 3D for the ticket premium. Exception is IMAX showings, where I think they know people just want the 2D experience. 60% of sales being those four IMAX showings. | 40 minutes into presales for my area.  Almost triple Dune 2 on my first measurement for that, which was Day 2. Bit ahead of my first measurement for The Marvels, which was T-21, and I think about a week into sales. They're really leaning into 3D showings. I get the desire for theatres to get the extra premium, but I can't see a lot of people wanting to see this in 3D. | Has been up for sale on the Canadian East coast, presumably from 9:00 local time. I did a sweep of all showtimes on MTC4, but there's been zero sales so far (May 20).)

- YM! (Sold ~10.6x Furiosa's T-6. One theater makes up a sizeable percentage of most mid-sized Marvel's T-2 in a span of hours. Such a strong start.

About 20% more showings than IO2 and about the same amount of PLFs spread and likely 3-4 screens a theater for Thursday previews, but has SuperScreen, in addition to two UltraScreen screens in Majestic Cinema. There seems to be a 3D push with North Shore having primetime showings in 3D UltraScreen (May 19).)

For the worst, they chose 1929, 2005, 2009, and 2020. For the best, it was 1927, 1939, 1957, 1974, 1975, 1994, and 1999, Both are good videos and I highly suggest watching it but for those who haven't seen it, their reasoning for these years was more than just looking at what was released within the year and comparing quality. They looked at things from the box office, the changes they had on the industry as a whole, and the developments that influenced other films down the line.

2023 was a wild year for film: between some of the biggest bombs of all time dropping back to back, the writer and actors strike, the topic of AI in film, the box office success as it was the highest theater average since theaters re-opened, and of course a lot of good movies coming out.

I've been meaning to ask this question for a while but I wanted to wait a couple of motnhs so we aren't blinded by recency bias. With almost 5 months having passed in 2024, we have a better sense of the impact it had 2023. So I wanted to know: do y'all thought 2023 was good or bad for films?

Much like FilmStack, we're not looking at the quality of movies released this year - blockbuster or otherwise - because obviously that's subjective (although quality wise, I'd argue this is the best year since the pandemic and my personal favorite year for releases since 2016). Focus on the tangibles: the box office, the news stories with the strikes and streaming, what was awarded that year, and every other piece about the film and TV industry, not just whether or not you liked the films.",10,5

Very slow month for new releases resulting in the late releases dominating.  Beekeeper was number one and did not come out until the 23rd.  Madame Web literally came out the last day of the month and got 3rd (ironically its sales for the first week are not good.  I guess everybody who wanted to buy it bought it opening Tuesday).

Aquaman 2 got second.  It completely dominated the first 3/4ths of the month, and I thought it coming in first was a lock.  Apparently with the new releases the sales were way higher at the end of the month.

Wonka, Migration, and Hunger Games stay in the list, but Oppenheimer is finally out.  Have to give props to Paw Patrol.  They packaged a few episodes, and that made the top 10 list.

For the year list it is mostly the same.  Wonka passed Trolls, but other than that it is completely the same.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hit_man_2023) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** A deceptively dark thriller that's also loaded with laughs, *Hit Man* is an outstanding showcase for leading man Glen Powell -- and one of the most purely entertaining films of Richard Linklater's career.

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/hit-man/) 83 (39 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

‚ÄúHit Man‚Äù is studded with delicious moments, but as amusing as the movie is it has a plot that sprawls forward in a rather ungainly fashion, and it goes on for too long. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety

Smart and steamy screwball fun. - Leslie Felperin, Hollywood Reporter

The comedy is a deliriously entertaining star vehicle for actor Glen Powell. - Ben Croll, TheWrap

‚ÄúHit Man,‚Äù Linklater‚Äôs latest film, falls into the fun-with-a-heart (and brain) category. It‚Äôs got a lot going for it. For one thing, there‚Äôs Linklater‚Äôs deft touch, particularly when juggling comedy and romance (with a little crime drama thrown in). **4/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

A smartly written, sublimely comedic, and sexy human-scale relationship story with a touch of just enough suspense and hints of criminality to prove that its title is not a complete misnomer. **4/5** \- Cary Darling, Houston Chronicle

In the hands of a lesser director, Hit Man would surely have felt rather thin and disposable. But Linklater is a pro, and he manages to make the film‚Äôs fripperies feel borderline profound. **4/5** \- Xan Brooks, Guardian

An intelligent comedy that contains plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and references Kant and Nietzsche, it is also a thriller that is darker than it first appears. - Jo-Ann Titmarsh, London Evening Standard

Hit Man trips along on great writing, Linklater‚Äôs witty, light-touch direction and a rich sense of place, but what makes it especially pleasurable is Powell and Arjona‚Äôs naturally steamy rapport. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

... An effervescent comedy from Richard Linklater that simultaneously snubs its nose at the entire genre while easily nabbing the honour of most purely entertaining film to grace the Lido so far. **4/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

Another, crueller writer-director would have pivoted to scenes of bloody violence, but Linklater prefers to ponder the question of whether you can will yourself into becoming a different person. **4/5** \- Nicholas Barber, BBC.com

A sorta-true story about an average guy who finds himself caught in a web of crime and deception, Hit Man is a cute and clever (sometimes overbearingly so) showcase for Powell‚Äôs magnetic charm. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

The police scenes are just light enough to be funny, the screwball sequences are just dark enough to keep you on the edge of your seat, and Powell... is obviously elated to be handling such twisty material. - Shirley Li, The Atlantic

This genial comedy/noir is a genuine crowdpleaser ‚Äì funny, sexy, clever and confident in building a low-key humour which hits the target over and over again. - Fionnuala Halligan, Screen International

It‚Äôs a genuinely riotous time at the cinema and concrete proof Powell is perhaps our brightest hope when it comes to keeping the notion of the movie star alive. - Hannah Strong, Little White Lies

Hit Man is hot and hilarious, a winning combination amplified by a story that gets knottier at every turn. - Nick Schager, The Daily Beast

Powell‚Äôs ability to power through some dull material on charm alone only reaffirms the credibility of his stardom, and the film‚Äôs general lack of ambition keeps things from going awry whenever a joke doesn‚Äôt land. Aim small, miss small. **B-** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

I‚Äôs just fun to watch good old-fashioned comedy in which love, danger, and happy endings are all part of a damn fine evening at the movies. - Alissa Wilkinson, Vox

With Richard Linklater‚Äôs Hitman, the charismatic Glen Powell has been offered a plum opportunity to shape his image into something more complicated and often poignant. **3/4** \- Zach Lewis, Slant Magazine

\[A\] light-and-lively comedy. - Jordan Hoffman, The Messenger

Comfortably Linklater‚Äôs best movie since Boyhood, Hit Man stands alongside School of Rock for big laughs and good vibes ‚Äì albeit with a darker streak that slowly kicks in. **4/5** \- Philip De Semlyen, Time Out

Powell and Linklater would have done better to take Johnson‚Äôs story as a launching point and then spun off into their far more complicated version of his life without literally tethering the movie to a real person. - Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict

Linklater has long had a gift with playful humor, and he nails the tone here without turning ‚ÄúHit Man‚Äù into the slapstick it could have become. - Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com

A comedy/thriller that‚Äôs in equal parts charming, nerve-wracking, and ethically challenging. - Glenn Kenny, RogerEbert.com

Every interesting aspect of the true story and the imagined story are smoothed out. - Drew Gregory, Autostraddle

The smoldering, wily, wild-but-true Hit Man returns Linklater to his loquacious take on romance, with a man using his gift of gab to shrug off himself. - Charles Bramesco, Inside Hook

A witty, relaxed, and cheerfully fictionalized comedy-caper-romance; in the bargain there‚Äôs some light philosophical meditations on the impermanence of personality. **4/4** \- Ty Burr, Ty Burr's Watch List

It‚Äôs as if Linklater is playing posthumous wingman for his subject, giving him the rom-com-slick Hollywood ending he never got in life. - Keith Uhlich, (All (Parentheses))

**SYNOPSIS:**

Oscar-nominated director Richard Linklater‚Äôs sunlit neo-noir stars Glen Powell as strait-laced professor Gary Johnson, who moonlights as a fake hit man for the New Orleans Police Department. Preternaturally gifted at inhabiting different guises and personalities to catch hapless people hoping to bump off their enemies, Gary descends into morally dubious territory when he finds himself attracted to one of those potential criminals, a beautiful young woman named Madison (Adria Arjona). As Madison falls for one of Gary‚Äôs hit man personas ‚Äî the mysteriously sexy Ron ‚Äî their steamy affair sets off a chain reaction of play acting, deception, and escalating stakes. Co-written by Linklater and Powell and inspired by an unbelievable true story, Hit Man is a cleverly existential comedy about identity.

I really wonder why? The recent crop of vampire movies was quite diverse actually in themes - Morbius was comicbook vampire in modern setting, Last Voyage of Demeter was serious gothic  horror period piece about vampire, Renfield and Abigail were contemporary action horror black comedies with lots of gore. Yet all flopped.

But vampire movies used to be succesful with different flavours back in the day. Vampire movies set in modern times? We had hits in Lost boys, Fright Night in 1980s, Blade movies in 1990s, Underworld franchise in 2000-2010s and yeah Twilight franchise in 2000s-2010s, and of course What  We Do in The Shadows in 2010s. Vampire movies in period settings? Bram Stoker's Dracula and Interview with the Vampire movies in 1990s were hits.

So why did vampire genre fell off so big lately and why Dracula in particular stopped being interesting to modern audiences?",61,57

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

There will probably be atleast a few more movies scheduled for that weekend including potentialy Garfield.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_garfield_movie) Rotten

**Critics Consensus:** *The Garfield Movie* rolls along at a zany enough clip to be diverting for kids, but this animated adventure doesn't much resemble Jim Davis' iconically grumpy creation.

||**Score**|**Number of Reviews**|**Average Rating**|

|**Top Critics**|13%|24|3.60/10|

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-garfield-movie/) 30 (27 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

A terrible Monday of a film for the orange tabby whose storied laziness over nearly 50 years has certainly earned him better. - Carlos Aguilar, Variety

None of these meta references will be entertaining for the very young target audience, nor are they amusing for their adult chaperones. It‚Äôs indicative of the laziness and cynicism permeating this enterprise. - Frank Scheck, Hollywood Reporter

When I say 'The Garfield Movie' is the best 'Garfield' movie, it‚Äôs going to sound like faint praise. Because it is. But faint praise is still praise. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap

A curious new animated attempt to monetize the comic icon again by giving him an origin story and then asking him to do things a galaxy away from what he does in the funny pages. It‚Äôs like if Snoopy ran an underground bare-knuckle fight club. **1.5/4** \- Mark Kennedy, Associated Press

This movie has no reason to exist. So why‚Äôd you do it, Garfield? I know why. Lasagna prices have gone up and you know this is going to make money as Memorial Day weekend counterprogramming to ‚ÄúFuriosa.‚Äù **1.5/4** \- Odie Henderson, Boston Globe

Director Mark Dindal sadistically stretches out his tale, which is not only plodding but fundamentally misunderstands its title character. - Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail

Is this a kid‚Äôs movie or a commercial? And if it‚Äôs the latter, a commercial for what exactly? Certainly not more movies like this. **C** \- Kate Erbland, indieWire

Kids might be mildly entertained, but that doesn‚Äôt make this less of a hairball. **4/10** \- A.A. Dowd, IGN Movies

As long as there‚Äôs another excuse to slap Garfield on another t-shirt, let‚Äôs keep the train rolling with a new generation of fans. When brand perpetuation is as soulless and milquetoast as this, it seems unlikely that it will create any new fans at all. **C-** \- Leigh Monson, AV Club

**SYNOPSIS:**

Garfield (voiced by Chris Pratt), the world-famous, Monday-hating, lasagna-loving indoor cat, is about to have a wild outdoor adventure! After an unexpected reunion with his long-lost father ‚Äì scruffy street cat Vic (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) ‚Äì Garfield and his canine friend Odie are forced from their perfectly pampered life into joining Vic in a hilarious, high-stakes heist.

#**As Reddit doesn't allow posts to exceed 40,000 characters, Eastwood's edition had to be split into two parts because his whole career cannot be ignored. The first part was posted yesterday.**

#**Million Dollar Baby (2004)**¬®

*""Beyond his silence, there is a past. Beyond her dreams, there is a feeling. Beyond hope, there is a memory. Beyond their journey, there is a love.""*

His 25th film. Based on stories from the 2000 collection *Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner* by F.X. Toole, it stars Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. The film follows Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, an underdog amateur boxer who is helped by an underappreciated boxing trainer to achieve her dream of becoming a professional.

Paul Haggis wrote the script on spec, and it took four years to sell it. The film was stuck in development hell for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, would not agree to a $30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. contributing the rest.

The film had an incredible run in limited release, breaking many records for Eastwood's career. It eventually earned a fantastic $216 million worldwide, becoming his highest grossing film ever. It received critical acclaim, and it was named as one of his greatest films. It won four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (for Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (for Freeman). Eastwood became one of the very few directors to make two films to win both Best Picture and Best Director.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $100,492,203. ($166.8 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $216,763,646.

#**Flags of Our Fathers (2006)**

*""A single shot can end the war.""*

His 26th film. Based on the book written by James Bradley and Ron Powers, it stars Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford, Adam Beach, John Benjamin Hickey, John Slattery, Paul Walker, Jamie Bell, Barry Pepper, Robert Patrick and Neal McDonough. The film follows the 1945 Battle of Iwo Jima, the five Marines and one Navy corpsman who were involved in raising the flag on Iwo Jima, and the after effects of that event on their lives.

The film received positive reviews, but it bombed at the box office with just $65 million against its huge $90 million budget.

- **Budget:** $90,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $33,602,376. ($52.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $65,900,249.

#**Letters from Iwo Jima (2006)**

*""The completion of the Iwo Jima saga.""*

His 27th film. Based on *Picture Letters from Commander in Chief* by Tadamichi Kuribayashi, it stars Ken Watanabe, Kazunari Ninomiya, Tsuyoshi Ihara, Ry≈ç Kase and Shid≈ç Nakamura. It's a companion film to *Flags of Our Fathers*, and portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of the Japanese soldiers.

In the process of reading about the Japanese perspective of the war for *Flags of Our Fathers*, in particular General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, Eastwood decided to film a companion piece with this film, which was shot entirely in Japanese. The film was shot back-to-back, starting filming just one month after *Flags of Our Fathers* wrapped filming.

Despite being seen as the least accessible of both films, this film was much more successful at the box office than the previous film (including a colossal $42 million in Japan alone). It also received critical acclaim, particularly for how it handed the depiction of good and evil from both sides. It received 4 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director.

- **Budget:** $19,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $13,756,082. ($21.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $68,673,228.

#**Changeling (2008)**

*""To find her son, she did what no one else dared.""*

His 28th film. It stars Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich, and is based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop murders in Mira Loma, California. It follows a woman united with a boy who she realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate that to the police and city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother and confined to a psychiatric ward. 

The film earned $113 million worldwide, barely breaking even at the box office. The film received mixed reviews, but Jolie received praise for her performance. She was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actress.

- **Budget:** $55,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $35,739,802. ($52 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $113,398,237.

#**Gran Torino (2008)**

*""Ever come across somebody you shouldn't have messed with?""*

His 29th film. It stars Eastwood, and follows Walt Kowalski, a recently widowed Korean War veteran alienated from his family and angry at the world, whose young neighbor, Thao Vang Lor, is pressured by his cousin into stealing Walt's prized Ford Torino for his initiation into a gang. Walt thwarts the theft and subsequently develops a relationship with the boy and his family.

The film received great reviews, as well as praise from the Hmong community. It ended up becoming a sleeper hit, and it earned $270 million worldwide, becoming his highest grossing film.

- **Budget:** $25,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $148,095,302. ($215.6 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $269,958,228.

#**Invictus (2009)**

*""His people needed a leader. He gave them a champion.""*

His 30th film. It stars Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Following the aftermath of the apartheid, President Nelson Mandela decides to unite his people by supporting a rugby team in their bid to win the 1995 Rugby World Cup.

The film earned $122 million worldwide, barely breaking even. It received positive reviews, and Freeman and Damon received Oscar nominations for their performances.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $37,491,364. ($54.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $122,426,792.

#**Hereafter (2010)**

*""Touched by death. Changed by life.""*

His 31st film. It stars Matt Damon, C√©cile de France, Bryce Dallas Howard, Lyndsey Marshal, Jay Mohr and Thierry Neuvic. An American with a special connection to the afterlife, a woman with a near-death experience and a young English boy, who lost his loved ones, cross paths in an effort to find closure in their lives.

Despite mixed reviews, it managed to earn $107 million, turning a small profit.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $32,746,941. ($47 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $106,956,330.

#**J. Edgar (2011)**

*""The most powerful man in the world.""*

His 32nd film. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Armie Hammer, Naomi Watts, Josh Lucas, and Judi Dench, and follows the career of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, focusing on Hoover's life from the 1919 Palmer Raids onward.

The film received mixed reviews; while DiCaprio received praise, the technical aspects of the film were criticized. It earned $84 million, making it a box office success, but far below what DiCaprio usually makes at the box office.

- **Budget:** $35,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $37,306,030. ($52 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $84,920,539.

#**Jersey Boys (2014)**

*""Everybody remembers it how they need to.""*

His 33rd film. Base on the 2004 jukebox musical, it stars John Lloyd Young, Erich Bergen, Michael Lomenda, Vincent Piazza and Christopher Walken, and tells the story of the musical group The Four Seasons.

It received mixed reviews, with praise for the musical numbers but criticism for the narrative and runtime, and failed at the box office.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $47,047,013. ($62.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $67,647,013.

#**American Sniper (2014)**

*""The most lethal sniper in U.S. history.""*

His 34th film. It is based on the memoir by Chris Kyle, Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, and stars Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. The film follows the life of Kyle, who became the deadliest marksman in U.S. military history with 255 kills from four tours in the Iraq War, 160 of which were officially confirmed by the Department of Defense. While Kyle was celebrated for his military successes, his tours of duty took a heavy toll on his personal and family life.

In 2012, Cooper and Warner Bros. bought the rights to the memoir. Cooper wanted Chris Pratt to star as Kyle, but WB told him they would only greenlight the film if he stars in it. After Kyle's murder in 2013, Steven Spielberg signed to direct. Spielberg had read Kyle's book, though he desired to have a more psychological conflict present in the screenplay so an ""enemy sniper"" character could serve as the insurgent sharpshooter who was trying to track down and kill Kyle. Spielberg's ideas contributed to the development of a lengthy screenplay approaching 160 pages. Due to Warner Bros.' budget constraints, Spielberg felt he could not bring his vision of the story to the screen. So Eastwood was brought in to direct.

The film attained a solid, but not extraordinary response from critics. It also attracted some controversy over its portrayal of both the Iraq War and Kyle himself. 

The box office though? 

To say that the film had a fantastic run would be selling it short.

It opened on Christmas Day in 4 theaters, and it earned a huge $633,456 ($158,364 PTA). But the following weekend, it actually increased despite playing at the same amount of theaters, adding $676,909. That translated to a $169,227 PTA, becoming the highest second weekend PTA in history for a live-action film. And on its third weekend, it earned $579,518 ($144,879 PTA), becoming the first film to have three weekends above $100,000 PTA. In the 22 days it played in just 4 theaters, it earned $3,424,778.

On its first wide weekend, the film shook the industry by opening with a colossal $89 million. That was almost as much as the other 2014 blockbusters, and given that the film didn't have 3D pricing, it's very likely it sold far more tickets than them. It broke the January opening weekend record by twice as much, and the second biggest for an R-rated title. With insane word of mouth (""A+"" on CinemaScore), this film had *the* legs. In less than one week, it became Eastwood's highest grossing film domestically. On its second weekend, it dropped just 28% and made $64 million, which was the biggest second weekend for an R-rated film (a record it still maintains) and crossed $200 million domestically. And by March, the film overtook *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1* ($334 million) as the highest grossing 2014 film in North America.

After an insane run in theaters, it closed with a gigantic $350 million domestically, which made it the second highest grossing R-rated film in North America. Overseas, it was also very strong, and it made a huge $547 million worldwide. It was easily Eastwood's highest grossing film, even adjusted for inflation. One of the greatest box office runs in recent memory. It received six Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor for Cooper, ultimately winning one for Best Sound Editing.

The biggest surprise of the 2010s? Perhaps. Cause let's face it, when 2014, did any of you had this as the top film of the year? Or even in the Top 20? Please.

- **Budget:** $59,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $350,159,020. ($463.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $547,659,020.

#**Sully (2016)**

*""The untold story behind the miracle on the Hudson.""*

His 35th film. Based on the autobiography *Highest Duty* by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Skiles, it stars Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, and Jamey Sheridan. The film follows Sullenberger's 2009 emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, in which all 155 passengers and crew survived and the subsequent publicity and investigation.

The film received strong reviews, and earned over $240 million worldwide, becoming one of his highest grossing films.

- **Budget:** $60,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $125,070,033. ($163.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $243,870,033.

#**The 15:17 to Paris (2018)**

*""The real heroes.""*

His 36th film. Based on the autobiography by Jeffrey E. Stern, Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, and Alek Skarlatos, it stars Stone, Sadler, and Skarlatos as themselves and follows the trio through life leading up to and including their stopping of the 2015 Thalys train attack.

Despite choosing Kyle Gallner, Jeremie Harris and Alexander Ludwig as the leads, Eastwood decided to cast the heroes to play themselves, which was met with confusion as they lacked acting experience. And that was reflected on the final film; it received negative reviews for its acting, and it bombed at the box office.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $36,276,286. ($45.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $57,176,286.

#**The Mule (2018)**

*""Nobody runs forever.""*

His 37th film. Based on the 2014 The New York Times article *The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule* by Sam Dolnick, it stars Eastwood, Bradley Cooper, Laurence Fishburne, Michael Pe√±a, Dianne Wiest, and Andy Garc√≠a. Due to financial issues, horticulturist Earl Stone becomes a courier for a drug cartel. Slowly, he grows closer to his estranged family, but his illegal activities threaten much more than his life.

It received good reviews (although some questioned its story and tone), and earned over $173 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $103,804,407. ($129.6 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $174,804,407.

#**Richard Jewell (2019)**

*""The world will know his name and the truth.""*

His 38th film. The film stars Paul Walter Hauser, Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, and Olivia Wilde. The film depicts the July 27 Centennial Olympic Park bombing and its aftermath, as security guard Richard Jewell finds a bomb during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, and alerts authorities to evacuate, only to later be wrongly accused of having placed the device himself.

The film received positive reviews, but several journalists criticized the critical portrayal of the reporter that first accused Jewell: Kathy Scruggs (specifically for trading sex for stories). The film marked another commercial failure for Eastwood.

- **Budget:** $45,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $22,345,542. ($27.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $44,645,542.

#**Cry Macho (2021)**

*""A story of being lost and found.""*

His 39th film. Based on the novel by N. Richard Nash, it stars Eastwood and Dwight Yoakam. Set in 1979, it follows a former rodeo star hired to reunite a young boy in Mexico with his father in the United States. 

Nash tried to get this film made all the way since 1970s, but no studio was willing to pick it up. He restructured his films as a novel, was successful and studios were now interested. There were a few candidates for the leading role; Robert Mitchum, Roy Scheider, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Eastwood himself. Arnie was willing to star in the film back in 2003, but put it on hold when he was elected Governor. He was set to star after leaving office, but the project was scrapped after his affair scandal was made known. In 2020, Eastwood signed to return.

The film received mixed reviews, particularly for its writing and acting. It was also a huge flop at the box office, and marked Eastwood's least attended film as leading man. David Zaslav criticized the studio's decision to finance the film. Warner executives allegedly said that although they knew the film was unlikely to turn a profit, they felt indebted to Eastwood for his decades-long relationship with the studio and his consistent ability to deliver films under budget and on time.

- **Budget:** $33,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $10,310,734. ($11.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $16,510,734.

#**The Future**

He recently wrapped post-production on his 40th film, *Juror No. 2*. It stars Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Zoey Deutch, Leslie Bibb, Chris Messina, J. K. Simmons and Kiefer Sutherland, and follows a juror serving on a murder trial who realizes he may be at fault for the victim's death.

#**The Verdict**

Insanely profitable. 

Even the bombs do not taint this kind of reputation. Eastwood has made all these films under budget and never past its deadline. That's something that has to be treasured for studios, no wonder he's been staying with Warner Bros. since 1976. His ability to get films ready in short notice is impressive; *Richard Jewell* started filming in June and it was on theaters in December. One of the most impressive actors who transitioned into directors. You can tell that Sergio Leone and Don Siegel taught him well. 

Now of course, his method of directing can also have its setbacks: he's often known for not asking for multiple takes and he skips rehearsals. So that means the performances of his actors aren't always the best they could've done. Which is why, despite making some masterpieces or fantastic films, he's also made a few films with weak technical aspects: poor lighting (*J. Edgar*), questionable logic (*Cry Macho*), obvious props (the fake baby in *American Sniper*), and some bad acting (*Gran Torino* and *The 15:17 to Paris*). At the same time, it's clear he can also get extraordinary performances through these methods; Gene Hackman, Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won Oscars for starring in his films. 

He also proved old age doesn't prevent you from continuing to work. He's turning 94 in a few weeks, and he's still directing films. Manoel de Oliveira directed films until he was 104, so perhaps we still have a few more years with Eastwood behind the camera.

P.S. Ever since I started this series, there's been suggestions that I should do ""Actors at the Box Office"" multiple times. While the idea is intriguing, that doesn't seem feasible for me. I'd have to categorize whether the actor is leading, supporting, original IP, adaptation, remakes, etc. Besides, with the continuing decline of star power, it's tough to decide what actor is truly moving the needle at the box office. That's why I'm making solely ""Directors at the Box Office"", because the director is responsible for the production. If the film succeeds, the director will get credit. And if the film flops, the director will be blamed. So this is the closest you'll get to ""Actors at the Box Office"".

**Sample Reviews:**

As a stand-alone film (which it isn‚Äôt, but let‚Äôs pretend for a moment), ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù is by turns convoluted, ambitious, intriguing, and meandering. But it‚Äôs never quite moving. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety

Any of these plotlines might have sustained an hour of compelling television but they don‚Äôt add up to much in this awkwardly stitched quilt, which rarely provides the space for anyone‚Äôs experiences to resonate. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter 

Part of the pleasure of Horizon is the sheer, magisterial sweep of the thing ‚Äì with mountains and buttes and mesas like these, who needs CG? But its texture lives in small, telling details. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK) 

Costner boasts an instinctive understanding of the archetype and thus elevates the role and each line beyond the possibility of camp. **3/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK) 

But a film ‚Äì certainly a Western ‚Äì needs to have a plot, a bit of credible characterisation, and a structure that preferably includes a beginning, middle and end. Horizon doesn't have any of those. **1/5** \- Nicholas Barber, BBC.com

At least Horizon accomplishes one staggering feat: it makes one wonder if we were maybe a little too hard on The Postman. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

The biggest problem with Horizon is that, even with its lengthy running time, Costner has only scratched the surface of the ‚Äúsaga‚Äù he‚Äôs trying to tell. There is no arc to what happens, just the seemingly unending introduction of characters. - Esther Zuckerman, The Daily Beast 

These aren‚Äôt characters so much as the spokes of a plot in human form, each of their storylines moving as if being pulled by horses across the entire span of the American West. **C-** \- Ryan Lattanzio, indieWire

Every magnificent vista and each swooningly romantic moment can‚Äôt make up for the fact that Horizon is excruciatingly dull. - Hoai-Tran Bui. Inverse 

While the first film in the possible ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù series does well in setting up future pictures, this single film is a chore to sit through. **2/4** \- Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

In the great tradition of Warner Bros. Pictures‚Äô iconic Westerns, ‚ÄúHorizon: An American Saga‚Äù explores the lure of the Old West and how it was won‚Äîand lost‚Äîthrough the blood, sweat and tears of many. Spanning the four years of the Civil War, from 1861 to 1865, Costner‚Äôs ambitious cinematic adventure will take audiences on an emotional journey across a country at war with itself, experienced through the lens of families, friends and foes all attempting to discover what it truly means to be the United States of America.

#**Weekend Box Office (May 17th-19th)**

The Last Frenzy back on top this weekend ending out the new release Hovering Blade which in turn edges of Twilight of the Warriors for 2nd. 

Planet of the Apes records a solid 2nd weekend drop to land in 4th.

A slew of romance flicks litter the charts but none really making a significant impact.

Meanwhile The Fall Guy debuts with a dissastrous $0.71M. Below pretty much any other big budget Holywood movie in the last 2 years only really beating Madame Web which opened with $0.66M. It debuted below movies like M3GAN, Gran Turismo, TMNT:MM. Less than 1/3 of the opening weekends of flops like Indy and The Little Mermaid. Nowhere near stuff like Shazam 2 and Dungeons and Dragons.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

There will probably be atleast a few more movies scheduled for that weekend including potentialy Garfield.

Sadly the movie only made about 900k admits in the last week and that's with a holiday boost. It will need some help if it wants to beat Exhuma which I don't see happening.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: I'm not disappointed by a 53% drop from last weekend. The movie is still going to fail to reach War but it will have significantly better legs. 

Haikyuu: Impressive for the anime movie pulling in 348k admits in its opening. I wonder if the frontloaded of anime will prevent us from sniffing a million. I'm guessing we will end up with 700k admits if we see the usually 70% drop that most anime suffer.

Garfield: I'm not impressed by the weekend. The opening day being bigger than the entire weekend is not something you want from an animated kids movie. 

IF: I'm kinda surprised this is going to at least hit a million dollars. However I'm not really pumped as the weekend was still pretty small. 

KP4: Just a typical 90% drop from last weekend. Pretty sad that it can't even sniff 2 million admits. 

Challengers: A solid 45% drop as the movie has pretty much beaten everyone's expectations.

Exhuma: A not so great 64% drop as the movie will fall short by a good bit of 12 million admits. What a massive success of a movie tho.

The Fall Guy: A nasty 86% drop

Dune 2: A rough 78% drop as the movie is 304 admits from breaking 2 million admits

In any other context, the answer would be ""no,"" and indeed in certain online circles I see folks continuing to insist it was an abject flop nobody cares about ‚Äì but Encanto is a fascinating case study because of its post-box office life.

On streaming, the film exploded, and now is a reliable merch machine for the company. New product lines continue to be launched featuring its characters. Park experiences have either debuted or are planned (the godawful Dinoland in Animal Kingdom is being axed in favour of Encanto and Indiana Jones), and you'll just as commonly see a little Mirabel wandering Epcot as you will Elsas or Rapunzels. This is to say nothing of the soundtrack, which topped the charts globally.

With all this in mind, has the film turned a profit at this stage? What do we think are the odds of Disney revisiting this IP for a sequel or series? It's a very unique, interesting example of how home media can salvage a movie.",127,306

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Furiosa Thursday Comp *assuming $5M for keysersoze123*: $4.49M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.46M Thursday comp. GxK obviously really propping the average up but for now I could see that settling at around $5 Million, still good pace! (May 12). Really good stuff in this market (May 9). Reallyyyyyy good day 1 here. I want to note that: NO I do NOT think preview numbers will be that high; it's just highlighting the fact that this is likely a movie that will be running hot in my market, as cinephile blockbusters usually do. Next update I will have T-14 comps, which will be a lot lower due to the short release window (May 8).)

- AniNate (Encouraging to see the weekend fill out a bit. Been seeing a lot of promotion during the basketball playoffs so general awareness has to be getting there now. (May 15). Skimmed through Thur/Fri and Valley View (Cleveland vicinity) has sold roughly 60 Furiosa tix so far while Tinseltown (Canton) has sold 40. I'm guessing the upfront audience does lean more toward the urban/cosmopolitan sensibilities (May 9). Presales show there's definitely some hype for this. Regal gonna irritate trackers again, offering no upcharge IMAX for Furiosa (May 8).)

- Charlie Jatinder ($3.05M Thursday comp.)

- el sid ($5.8M average Thursday comp (without Exorcist 2) (May 12). Furiosa continues its strong performance in ""my"" theaters. The movie yesterday had already 1.310 sold tickets (for Thursday, May 23). Up 15% in ca. 24 hours which isn't bad at all after the first rush.  Already comfortably in front of The Fall Guy's final sales (it had 1.071 counted on Thursday for Thursday) and almost on par with Civil War's final sales (1.357) and also the Apes finally had not more than 1.657 sold tickets in my theaters (May 11). I also can't complain about Furiosa's presales in my theaters, not at all. Already 1,138 sold tickets (in all of ""my"" 7 theaters) for May 23. 14 days left. Promising start. Civil War on Thursday of the release week for Thursday had 1,357 sold tickets and The Fall Guy finally had 1,071 sold tickets (May 9).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.94M Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Definitely chugging along. I am feeling good about 5m+ previews (May 15). It has way stronger sales than Garfield and that is expected. I am thinking of 5m previews for now (May 14). I think this is a solid OD presales. With a short PS window its probably looking at 5m+ previews (May 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.71M Thursday comp. Second straight day of weak growth. Not a great sign (May 18). First meh day since presales started (May 17). Keeps climbing at a strong pace (May 11). This continues to grow at an excellent rate (May 10). Really strong day 2. The short presales is for sure a factor (May 9). Not seeing much of a breakout. Still pretty solid start to presales (May 8).)

- vafrow ($3.5M Thursday comp. A bit of a step back today (May 18). It's starting to heat up (May 17). Comps are showing as steady since the last update, but it actually dipped quite a bit this week before rebounding today. Advance ticket buying has been so off in this market recently for some reason. Holding pace with Apes is a good sign (May 16). It had a good day (May 12). Mediocre day 2 (May 10). Not the hottest start. IMAX is the format of choice though, so, ATP will be high (May 9).)

- YM! (Southeast Wisconsin: Pretty solid I guess for Furiosa. Seems that most of it's business is in the Marcus Theaters in Mequon/Waukesha so not really expecting much a diverse showing but there seems to be a fanbase around it. Feel good in everyone's 4.5-5M previews range (May 17).)

**Hit Man**

- vafrow (Getting a theatrical release up here in Canada, and early signs are that it might get a pretty decent screen count. Not super wide or anything, but a pretty decent amount for a weekend that has a lot of other releases (May 14).)

**The Garfield Movie Thursday / EA+Thursday Comp: $1.22M/$1.97M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.72M EA comp and $1.19M Thursday comp.  The two comps that are most helpful, Wish and Trolls (not PLF, EA on a weekend, family movies) are both pointing to a lot lower than average, so I'm inclined to give those a lot more weight. I'm thinking $500-600k for EA (May 18). Still not really accelerating, and the EA is falling against comps (May 12). Good EA numbers, but many of these comps were PLF-only EA, which this is not, so I think the ATP will be quite lower and that should be adjusted for (May 9).)

- AniNate (EA screenings are pretty filled to the brim here now for what that's worth. Maybe a surge in family demand will present itself later next week (May 17). EA sales look decent now, but this does feel rather weak compared to the IF presales. Not 100% certain what's going on here but based on this I buy the trades' opening estimates over the forum vibes (May 15). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11).)

- el sid (The very even sales are a good sign (May 7). For Sunday, May 19, I can already report that also in my theaters it looks very good for Garfield. They will for sure add shows soon. It has so far only 1 show/theater and the shows are almost sold out, between 1 and 4 seats are still available. So my guess still is that this movie if it's not totally bad (and first reviews here were quite positive) will become a (big) hit. Seems not much on Thursday but it's a step in the right direction (May 6).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.91M EA comp and $1.11M Thursday comp. Lightyear probably the best comp here size-wise for Early Access, probably ends around 750-800k (May 18).)

- keysersoze123 (4 days later.  Almost no pace so far. Sunday shows are near sellout and so limited growth. Previews are like 35% of Panda 4 and Friday is under 1/3rd. That said this will under index in MTC1 as Panda also did that. Still struggling to see this as a breakout. Looking at the current state, it looks like half of IF as well !!! Of course that had Reynolds and did not finish that great (May 17). Its definitely weaker than even Elemental. That said these movies tend to finish strong and so I am not  writing it off so early. Just that the long PS window is irrelevant for them. They could rather start presales like a week before release and it would be all the same. | Meh. We have to wait until next week to gauge where its going to finish. It has very low ATP as well and actual would be even lower as its going to see tons of kids tickets (May 14). Early shows are regular digital shows at 1PM this sunday. So ATP will be very low. I think 500k ish at best. Preview let us see how things go in the final week. Presales at this point are almost non existent (May 13).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.18M Thursday comp. Not much movement at all in the past week. Probably heading to $2M+ (May 17).)

- vafrow ($0.4M Thursday comp. Comps don't paint a pretty picture though. EA shows are doing okay (May 11). Still no sales for my core sample for previews. But I did the larger sweep, which shows the interest right now is the Sunday early access shows. Looking at sales patterns, it's mainly blocks of 3/4 tickets, so likely families grabbing some. It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4).)

- YM! (The combined previews total for Garfield is 35 tickets with 23 tickets coming from EA, which is pretty solid. Still thinking around 2-2.75m previews with EA as while not as widespread, the showings seem like they‚Äôre filling up nicely. Think Garfield does about the same as IF though OW as due to the likely lower ATP Keyser hinted at iirc and seemingly little screen space with no PLFs. | Meh, kids animation doesn't really make much notion until the Monday for release and Garfield seems indicative of that. Thinking the 1.5-2M Thursday previews range folks were spitting out makes sense. Nothing screams breakout though and the fact it's getting one screen, maybe two at most for previews makes me feel like OW might be similar to IF (May 17).)

**Bad Boys: Ride or Die Thursday / EA+Thursday comp: $3.64M/$5.30M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.78M Thursday comp. These numbers are from last Thursday, as per my post this morning. This is a more walk-up movie a la Aquaman or Apes so I think it's a pretty good start (May 18). Pretty good start for it honestly (May 16).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.30M EA+Thursday comp.)

- TheFlatLannister ($3.68M Thursday comp. Well, this is a pretty good start (May 17).)

- YM! (Again, another solid start-ish. I expect Bad Boys to have the most diverse audience. Can't really predict much on previews but I am feeling confident in the 55-60m OW range for the past few weeks (May 17).)

- vafrow ($3.45M Thursday comp. Comps are not the greatest. One, surprisingly hard to find a comparable film with similar start on sales. Plus, I think ticket buying patterns have changed pretty drastically in my market over the last few months. There's very little up front sales compared to late 2023. Dune was the exception (May 17).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.66M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.67M Thursday comp. Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here sadly, but we shall see where it goes (May 15).)

- AniNate (It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 Thursday preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first Thursday at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15).)

- charlie Jatinder ($11.37M Thursday comp at MTC2.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($6.21M Thursday comp. Early sales just haven't been there lately except for the extreme fans. $12.27M Mario comp (May 18). Already at 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  For comparison, Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (At least the show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Too early to judge presales as ticket sales just started early this morning. Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective its way bigger than all animation movies seen recently including Panda 4. Easily the biggest I have seen in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (VERY BAD COMPS: $8.06M Thursday comp.  What a strange pre-sale pattern.  Threw in Shazam 2 and Barbie simply due to having nothing suitable at T-27, and I wanted something that was backloaded in pre-sales.  Was prepared to make a smart-aleck comment about the unsuitability of the pre-sale pattern of Barbie, but after today's update... Okay, yeah.  Still no.  But what a weird pattern.  Was there some sort of promo that dropped today that I'm not aware of?  Either way, just a great day (for this type of movie at this point in pre-sales) (May 17). Fairly strong day today, actually.  Was concentrated at a couple of theaters (including a small group sale at one showing), but still, sales are sales (May 16). I really do not have good comps for this movie.  Like, at all.  Especially for D1. With that in mind, I did some digging and did manage to get the Elemental D1 numbers out of the old Tracking thread: IO2 = 5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Now will Inside Out 2 be as backloaded as Elemental?  Well it's tough to literally sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days that Elemental did, so perhaps not.  But it does show how fracking backloaded purely kids animation is. Anyway, this is 30 days out and it isn't a CBM film (like AtSV) or CBM-adjacent film (like Incredibles 2).  The Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales so not exactly a great comp. 3.5% of presales are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the Saturday of release weekend (ie NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost the OW slightly, depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister ($8.97M Thursday comp. Definitely the biggest rollout in showings since I've started tracking Florida. Bigger than even Dune 2 and it's only T-26 (May 18). This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for Thursday (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for Thursday (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for Thursday at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base Thursday rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow (No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of premium formats, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the premium formats (May 15).)

- YM! (Seems IO2 is playing more like a kid's animation than a family event in start of presales. However, it is pretty solid for what it is. Do not have comparisons for anything but I like that Majestic is healthy and it about 66% of Garfield T-6. Thinking anywhere from 75m-100m OW rn but can change as we go along (May 17). In fairness it's only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a Thursday. It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

**Deadpool and Wolverine**

- keysersoze123 (Only number that matters is OD presales. after few days it will hit a trough and then it will plod along until social media reactions and reviews hit close to release. I think we can kind of predict its OW after its OD presales (May 18). RESPONSE TO PORTHOS: Captain Marvel had very strong sales on its OD despite early start. So OD is all about fans. It does not matter if you start 2 weeks before or 9 weeks. They will still book. So it would be interesting to compare OD sales not only with CM for @Porthos but also the big openers in 2022/23 period from MTC perspective.  1) DS2 - 230k ish. 2) Thor 4 - 136k ish. 3) Wakanda - 110k. 4) Ant 3 - 88K. 5) Guardians 3 - 70k ish.  I wonder where Deadpool 3 will land. Anything is fine as long as it does pull in a Marvels (May 17).)

- Porthos (No point of comparison for a movie starting presales this early (60+ days before release). Only MCU entry which comes close was Captain Marvel back in Jan of 2019 (T-58 start date).  Aside from that, the only other Disney release would be TROS starting at T-59.  This is gonna be the longest pre-sale window for a major Disney release since The Last Jedi all the way back in 2017 (which looks to be around 70 days if a cursory check of when tickets went on sale is correct). Hell, it's gonna be the longest major release of *any* studio since Fast X's execrable 99 day pre-sale window.  Have had some that came close-ish, but probably the most on-point recent comparison will be Jurassic World 3's 43 day pre-sale window, which is still over three weeks shorter than this one. I mention this because the sheer length of the pre-sale window will very likely depress the D1/D2/D3 sales somewhat.  Maybe not much, but you can't tell me there'd be no difference between a T-21 launch, a T-29 launch, a T-35 launch and a T-65 launch.  Sure, it's a matter of smaller degrees when comparing something like a BP2 (starting at T-38), but that extra month is probably gonna slice some numbers off the top of the pile, especially after the first day (May 17).)

#**As Reddit doesn't allow posts to exceed 40,000 characters, Eastwood's edition had to be split into two parts because his whole career cannot be ignored. The second part will be posted tomorrow.**

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Clint Eastwood's turn.

Eastwood was a troublemaker at school, and he had a bunch of odd jobs such as lifeguard, paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy. In 1951, he was drafted into the United States Army during the Korean War and was discharged two years later. Through this, he got into contact with a Hollywood representative, who got him into acting classes and started his acting career. He got his start by starring in the hit show *Rawhide*, but he said he was exhausted by the experience. This caught the attention of some film producers and he decided to act in films directed by the then-unknown Sergio Leone. His career was on the rise, and then he got the chance to make his directorial debut.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, some of the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**Play Misty for Me (1971)**

*""The scream you hear may be your own!""*

His directorial debut. It stars Eastwood, Jessica Walter and Donna Mills, and follows a radio disc jockey being stalked by an obsessed female fan.

Before his colleague Irving Leonard died, he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of producing a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired, and his debut as a director. Eastwood said he was ready, ""I stored away all the mistakes I made and saved up all the good things I learned, and now I know enough to control my own projects and get what I want out of actors.""

The film was a huge success for Eastwood, and it also received positive reviews. So far, his directorial career was off to a great start.

- **Budget:** $950,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $10,600,000. ($81.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $10,600,000.

#**High Plains Drifter (1973)**

*""They'd never forget the day he drifted into town.""*

His second film. The film stars Eastwood, Verna Bloom and Mariana Hill, and follows a mysterious stranger who metes out justice in a corrupt frontier mining town.

Eastwood reportedly liked the offbeat quality of the film's original nine-page proposal and approached Universal with the idea of directing it, which would make it his first directed Western. The screenplay was inspired by the real-life murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens in 1964, which eyewitnesses reportedly stood by and watched. Holes in the plot were filled in with black humor and allegory, influenced by Sergio Leone.

It was well received, and the film even surpassed *Play Misty for Me* at the box office. Eastwood was just going up.

- **Budget:** $5,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $15,700,000. ($110.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $15,700,000.

#**Breezy (1973)**

*""Her name is Breezy.""*

His third film. It stars William Holden and Kay Lenz, and follows the relationship between a middle-aged real estate agent and a young hitchhiker.

This was his first directed film without starring on it. And his lack of presence certainly hurt the film; it received mixed reviews and flopped at the box office.

- **Budget:** $750,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $200,000. ($1.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $217,753.

#**The Eiger Sanction (1975)**

*""His lifeline, held by the assassin he hunted.""*

His fourth film. Based on the novel by Trevanian, the film stars Eastwood, George Kennedy, Vonetta McGee, and Jack Cassidy. It follows Jonathan Hemlock, an art history professor, mountain climber, and former assassin once employed by a secret government agency, who is blackmailed into returning to his deadly profession for one last mission. 

The film received mixed reactions for its writing, and it wasn't a box office success either.

- **Budget:** $9,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $14,200,000. ($82.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,200,000.

#**The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976)**

*""An army of one.""*

His fifth film. Based on the novel *Gone to Texas* by Forrest Carter, it stars Eastwood, Chief Dan George, Sondra Locke, Bill McKinney and John Vernon. The film tells the story of Josey Wales, a Missouri farmer whose family is murdered by Union militia during the Civil War. Driven to revenge, Wales joins a Confederate guerrilla band and makes a name for himself as a feared gunfighter. After the war, all the fighters in Wales' group except for him surrender to Union soldiers, but the Confederates end up being massacred. Wales becomes an outlaw and is pursued by bounty hunters and Union soldiers as he tries to make a new life for himself.

Eastwood was fascinated by the novel and he bought the film rights, hoping to star on the film. He got Philip Kaufman involved as screenwriter and possible director, but left after disagreeing with Eastwood in the material adapted to the screen. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regard to their emerging relationship. This caused Eastwood to take over as the director. Kaufman's firing angered the DGA, as he did most of the pre-production, and sanctioning a $60,000 fine. This resulted in the Director's Guild passing a new rule, known as ""the Eastwood Rule"", which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then personally taking on the director's role.

The film received critical acclaim, and in subsequent years, is ranked among Eastwood's greatest films. It was also a huge success at the box office, doubling his previous highest grossing film. It was also one of the few Western films to receive critical and commercial success in the 1970s at a time when the Western was thought to be dying as a major genre in Hollywood.

- **Budget:** $3,700,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $31,800,000. ($174.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $31,800,000.

#**The Gauntlet (1977)**

*""The man in the middle of...""*

His sixth film. It stars Eastwood, Sondra Locke, Pat Hingle, William Prince, Bill McKinney, and Mara Corday. It follows a down-and-out cop who falls in love with a prostitute, to whom he is assigned to escort from Las Vegas to Phoenix for her to testify against the mob.

While it received mixed reviews, it became another box office success for Eastwood, becoming his now highest grossing film.

- **Budget:** $5,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $35,400,000. ($182.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $35,400,000.

#**Bronco Billy (1980)**

*""The most outrageous of 'em all.""*

His seventh film. The film stars Eastwood and Sondra Locke, and focuses on the financially-struggling owner of a traditional Wild West show and his new assistant.

It became another critical and commercial success for Eastwood, who referred to the film as one of his most affable shoots of his career.

- **Budget:** $6,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $24,265,659. ($91.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $24,265,659.

#**Firefox (1982)**

*""The most devastating killing machine ever built... his job... steal it!""*

His eighth film. Based on the novel by Craig Thomas, it stars Eastwood, Freddie Jones and David Huffman. The Soviets have developed a revolutionary new jet fighter, called ""Firefox"". Naturally, the British are worried that the jet will be used as a first-strike weapon, as rumors say that the jet is undetectable on radar. They send ex-Vietnam War pilot Mitchell Gant on a covert mission into the Soviet Union to steal the Firefox.

The film received mixed reviews, but it earned almost $47 million, becoming Eastwood's highest grossing title as director.

- **Budget:** $21,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $46,708,276. ($151.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $46,708,276.

#**Honkytonk Man (1982)**

*""The boy is on his way to becoming a man. The man is on his way to becoming a legend.""*

His ninth film. It's based on the novel by Clancy Carlile, and it stars Eastwood and his son Kyle. It follows Red Stovall, a country music singer and composer. With his nephew Whit by his side, he travels to Nashville to perform at the Grand Ole Opry in the backdrop of the Great Depression.

While the film received acclaim, it earned just $4.4 million, becoming his second worst performer.

- **Budget:** $2,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,484,991. ($14.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $4,484,991.

#**Sudden Impact (1983)**

*""Dirty Harry is at it again.""*

His tenth film. The fourth installment in the *Dirty Harry* series, directed, it stars Eastwood and Sondra Locke. The film tells the story of a gang rape victim who decides to seek revenge on her rapists 10 years after the attack by killing them one by one. Inspector Harry Callahan, famous for his unconventional and often brutal crime-fighting tactics, is tasked with tracking down the serial killer.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it earned over $150 million worldwide, Eastwood's first film to pass that milestone. It's also very popular for including the iconic catchphrase, ""Go ahead, make my day.""

- **Budget:** $22,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $67,642,693. ($212.1 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $150,642,693.

#**Pale Rider (1985)**

*""...And Hell followed with him.""*

His 11th film. It stars Eastwood, Michael Moriarty and Carrie Snodgress. A couple and their daughter, along with a few others, are driven out of Lahood, California, by goons working for a mining baron. However, a stranger enters their life to assist them in their fight.

There was no stopping Eastwood: another critical and commercial success.

- **Budget:** $6,900,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $41,410,568. ($120.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $41,410,568.

#**Heartbreak Ridge (1986)**

*""The scars run deep.""*

His 12th film. It stars Eastwood, Marsha Mason, Everett McGill, and Mario Van Peebles. The story centers on a U.S. Marine nearing retirement who gets a platoon of undisciplined Marines into shape and leads them during the American invasion of Grenada in 1983.

The film was inspired by an account of American paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division using a pay telephone and a credit card to call in fire support during the invasion of Grenada, and fashioned a script of a Korean War veteran career Army non-commissioned officer passing on his values to a new generation of soldiers. Eastwood was interested in the script and asked his producer, Fritz Manes, to contact the US Army with a view of filming the movie at Fort Bragg. However, the Army read the script and refused to participate, due to Highway being portrayed as a hard drinker, divorced from his wife, and using unapproved motivational methods to his troops, an image the Army did not want.

It received mixed reviews, with some deeming the film as ""imperialist propaganda"". But it was still another box office success.

- **Budget:** $15,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $42,724,017. ($121.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $121,700,000.

#**Bird (1988)**

*""There are no second acts in American lives.""*

His 13th film. The film stars Forest Whitaker and Diane Venora. It is constructed as a montage of scenes from saxophonist Charlie Parker's life, from his childhood in Kansas City, through his early death at the age of 34.

Eastwood, a lifelong fan of jazz, had been fascinated by Parker ever since seeing him perform live in Oakland in 1946. He approached Chan Parker, Bird's common-law wife on whose memoirs the script was based, for input, and she lent Eastwood and arranger Lennie Niehaus a collection of recordings from her private collection Before Eastwood was involved, Richard Pryor was originally cast as Parker.

Despitive positive reviews, it performed poorly, earning just $2.2 million in North America.

- **Budget:** $14,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,181,286. ($5.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,181,286.

#**White Hunter Black Heart (1990)**

*""An adventure in obsession.""*

His 14th film. Based on the novel by Peter Viertel, it stars Eastwood, Jeff Fahey, George Dzundza, Alun Armstrong and Marisa Berenson. It follows a famous movie director, John Wilson, who goes to Africa to make his next movie. He is an obstinate, contrary director who'd rather hunt elephants than take care of his crew or movie. He has become obsessed with one particular elephant and cares for nothing else.

Despite positive reviews, it made just $2.3 million domestically, not even 10% of the budget.

- **Budget:** $24,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,319,124. ($5.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $2,319,124.

#**The Rookie (1990)**

His 15th film. The film stars Eastwood, Charlie Sheen, Raul Julia, S√¥nia Braga, Lara Flynn Boyle, and Tom Skerritt. It follows a veteran police officer teamed up with a younger detective, whose intent is to take down a German crime lord in downtown Los Angeles, following months of investigation into an exotic car theft ring.

It received negative reviews for its acting and story, and it became another flop for Eastwood. That's three bombs in a row. Ouch.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,633,874. ($51.6 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $21,633,874.

#**Unforgiven (1992)**

*""Some legends will never be forgotten. Some wrongs can never be forgiven.""*

His 16th film. It stars Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Richard Harris and Morgan Freeman. It follows William Munny, a widower with two young kids, who was once a very vicious gunfighter who gave up everything after marriage. Now, a man named Schofield Kid brings him an offer that he cannot refuse, forcing him to come out of retirement for one last job.

David Webb Peoples wrote the script all the way back to 1976, and it was optioned by Francis Ford Coppola, but he lacked the funds needed to helm it. By Eastwood's own recollection, he was given the script in the ""early 80s"" although he did not immediately pursue it, because, according to him, ""I thought I should do some other things first"". Eastwood has long asserted that the film would be his last traditional Western, concerned that any future projects would simply rehash previous plotlines or imitate someone else's work. He dedicated the film to his close friends and mentors Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. Hackman initially refused to participate as his daughters were upset that he was starring in too many violent films, but he became fascinated by the script that he agreed.

It opened with $15 million and it legged all the way to $100 million after playing for almost one year, closing with $159 million worldwide, his now highest grossing film. The film received Eastwood's best reviews of his career, with many considering the film as his magnum opus as director. It received 9 Oscar nominations, and won four: Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood, Best Supporting Actor for Hackman, and Best Film Editing. So Eastwood, on top of being a reliable box office draw, was now a 2-time Oscar winner.

- **Budget:** $14,400,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $101,167,799. ($225.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $159,167,799.

#**A Perfect World (1993)**

His 17th film. Kevin Costner, Eastwood and Laura Dern, and follows an escaped convict who takes a young boy hostage and attempts to escape on the road with the child, while being pursued by a Texas Ranger.

The film received critical acclaim, and has appeared as one of Eastwood's best films. The film disappointed in North America, but it earned up to $100 million overseas (Eastwood's first film to gross that much) and ended with $135 million worldwide.

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $31,130,999. ($67.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $135,130,999.

- **Domestic gross:** $16,649,768. ($31.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $16,649,768.

Michael Keaton was originally cast in the role of Det. Sean Devine, and did several script readings with the cast, as well as his own research into the practices of the Massachusetts Police Department. However, creative differences between Keaton and Eastwood led to Keaton leaving the production. He was replaced by Kevin Bacon. This was the first film in which Eastwood would be credited as composer.

But it is too early to know for sure. Open caption (on-screen subtitles) screenings pre-sales are how we determine if a movie will be a hit. Why: most open caption screenings are at less popular times, and the majority of screenings do not have open captions. Therefore, when open caption screenings do pre-sell, that's an indication that people are actively seeking out the open caption screening and want to see the movie badly enough that they don't mind going at a less popular time. It also means people are planning way ahead to see the movie, with open captions when there are plenty of non-captioned screenings to choose from.

Right now, the overall numbers are lousy. The tickets sold/number of screen times ratio is terrible, less than 1 percent, for 45 tickets total pre-sold and 47 screentimes. However, there are glimmers here and there of a possible hit.

If there is enough interest, we can do another post with a table with all the data, updating it as the time gets closer.  For now, including a screenshot of the current data (still adding dates/screentimes to spreadsheet - it is time-consuming work).

Otherwise, we will not be posting about 'The Garfield Movie' again until, and unless,  the ticket/screentime ratio reaches 5 percent or higher. In our book, a movie does not achieve hit status until that ticket/screentime ratio is 5 percent or more.

We personally want to see the Garfield movie when it comes out and will be seeing an open caption screening of it. Have read and enjoyed the comic strip for years.

#**Daily Box Office (May 18th 2024)**
 
The market hits ¬•112M/$15.5M which is up +106% versus yesterday and up +24% versus last week.

**The Fall Guy** continues to massively underperform rising just +12% versus yesterday after evening bussiness collapses. It also already lost over 60% of its screenings from yesterday. 2 day total stands at just $0.53M matching Madame Web's 2 day total. Well below the 2 day totals of Argyle($1M), TLM($1.66M), Dial of Destiny($1.69M), Napoleon($2.04M), Wish($2.88M). Also bellow TMNT:MM($0.60M).

Weekend is looking like it will barelly limp past $0.70M. One of the most shockingly poor openings for a big budget holywood movie i can remember. This transends Holywood declining in China. Its just a straight up complete rejection of a movie.

---

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

There will probably be atleast a few more movies scheduled for that weekend including potentialy Garfield.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**Childrens Day(June 1st):**

Childrens Day is more official with Children under 14 getting half a day off. It mostly sees the release of a few animated movies and this year should be no different with Doraemon releasing on the date alongside a local animation. 

There will probably be atleast a few more movies scheduled for that weekend including potentialy Garfield.

**Sample Reviews:**

This long, scaldingly original film enthralls even as it frustrates, defying conventional logic while presenting an absurdist riff on modern society. It‚Äôs never boring, and yet, Lanthimos‚Äô outr√© sensibility demands a special brand of patience. - Peter Debruge, Variety

It may not be as thematically cohesive on a first watch as some audiences will wish for, but the longer you mull it over the more the pieces of the puzzle begin to fit and the common threads start to emerge. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter

Kinds of Kindness feels heavier and longer than I expected, as if reaching for a meaningful resolution that might not be there. Yet absence and loss is perhaps the whole point. **4/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, Guardian

For a film called Kinds of Kindness, benevolence is thin on the ground, Lanthimos and Filippou toying with their protagonists like fickle gods manipulating the fates of unsuspecting humans. **3/5** \- Raphael Abraham, Financial Times

A huge part of the fun is getting caught in the mesh of mind games the film sets for its audience... But it‚Äôs also a treat just to watch the well-picked ensemble show off their range in the constantly rotating supporting roles. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

There‚Äôs no kindness, in other words, in Kinds of Kindness. But that‚Äôs fine too, and probably all part of the brilliant, bravura joke. **4/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

A stiff, tedious follow-up to Poor Things... - Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine

Those hoping for some sense of grand meaning -- or, really, any kind of explanation of what‚Äôs going on -- are denied. Kinds of Kindness is clever and a bit snide, a curio cabinet not designed for beauty. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

It‚Äôs not cynicism but a chuckling curiosity that fuels this sideways parable, which aligns it with Lanthimos‚Äô past work in the most perfect of ways. You can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs a movie for everybody. But it takes all kinds. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

It can be a bit exhausting -- anthology films often are, and this one is long -- but we can feel the director‚Äôs excitement. He‚Äôs fully back in his sandbox. - Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture

A profoundly puzzling, dizzyingly disturbing and dark-hearted set of loosely-connected stories which manage to be discordantly amusing and strangely exhilarating -- a cinematic salt-rub. - Fionnuala Halligan, Screen International

Kinds of Kindness sees Lanthimos reconnecting with screenwriter Efthymis Filippou... This new film sees the pair working in a new, more-sophisticated and coruscating register than ever before. - David Jenkins, Little White Lies

This nearly three-hour bonfire of Searchlight Pictures‚Äô annual budget is a towering monument to human love that betrays almost zero interest in actually being liked. **B** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

**SYNOPSIS:**

KINDS OF KINDNESS is a triptych fable, following a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.

Last week, the monkeys truly conquered the cinemas as **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes** not only had a stellar opening, but out-grossed expectations.  For Mother's Day weekend, the reboot-sequel's actuals just squeezed past my **$4.46M Thurs** prediction and out-performed my **$13.45M Fri** estimate.  Caesar would be proud as KotPotA's actuals surpassed my **$19.41M Wed+Thurs+Fri** guesstimate.  Without any real stars and the concern over a follow-up to an acclaimed trilogy, this seems to be an absolute win for Disney/Fox.  Against a **$160M** price-tag, we should not expect to see the end of the apes anytime soon.

For the first time this Summer, theaters are faced with their first three-way opener competing as many screens as possible.  Thankfully, this new batch of titles is playing as the ultimate change of pace compared to the previous slew of action titles.  Filling in the family-friendly, two month void, the struggling Paramount Pictures is gambling with John Krasinski on **IF.**  No, this is not that terrible Blumhouse title from March.  Instead, IF is playing towards the younger crowd, who have been starved for two months since Kung Fu Panda 4.  Hopefully, the slew of stars and dry market will make up for the fact this is a truly *original* feature, which have tended to struggle on a grand scale in recent years.  Since students are slowly rolling out of schools right now, we will be using **Migration** as a comp.  In an attempt to make up from the light horror fare this year, **The Strangers: Chapter 1** is coming to not only bring in an audience from a cult favorite, but to kickstart the release of an already filmed trilogy.  As another early Summer horror outing, we will use **Tarot** as a comp.  Last up, the music biopic is back on a much smaller scale with **Back in Black.**  To follow suit, we will use **Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody** as a comp.  I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

https://preview.redd.it/upwxo4j3mw0d1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5f1a549eea8d08bf5aee084a49b2dbfc4875c9

After a long two months, families are about to served again, and they're ready to feast.  Due to its original nature, sales for Thursday seem to be more walk-up friendly.  This bodes well for the already strong sales for Friday.  At this rate, IF is looking to make up a **$2.19M Thurs** opening compared to Migration. As an early Summer release, IF is mostly playing like a standard young-skewing title during the normal school year, Thursday is not heavy, but Friday is looking pretty confident with **$8.27M** compared to Migration.  That number is a bit more comforting.  Even the theater capacities, where are decent, but not outstanding, signify a heavy lean towards Theater 2, which is very standard for family fare.  In a market where originality is hard to open, Paramount should pat themselves on the back for not only bringing out this big of an audience, but for simply trusting Krasinski and team to make it.

https://preview.redd.it/vdq15s55mw0d1.png?width=2346&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c9ccadac1244795953a4c4efddede33deacdb67

In a year of underwhelming horror, TS:C1 is looking to buck that trend.  With the small help of a built in fanbase, ticket sales not only started rather well, but have had a healthy consistent growth throughout the week.  Currently, TS:C1 is on track for a **$1.23M** compared to Tarot.  Definitely on the better side of horror than what we have seen this year.  Friday is looking to continue the confident trend with **$5.05M** compared to Tarot.  While Theater 1, a horror, walk-up friendly location, is sporting a healthy, but not spectacular theater capacity, the fact that the demand at Theater 2 a stronger number, it is possible the audience for TS:C1 might be bigger than originally expected.  Still, compared to Tarot, TS:C1 is showing a lot more demand from the audiences.  Even if it is not a breakout hit like the 2008 original, this is still a healthy outing to kick-off the new trilogy.

https://preview.redd.it/88jfwn17mw0d1.png?width=2348&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a63f964fac0b20a6c4c091a6267416be26fb5ef

Lastly, we are left with a reminder that not every real life story needs to be told.  Despite a relatively healthy start to sales with encouraging growth throughout the week, BtB is falling right in line with its comps to a sad, low outing.  At this rate, BtB may only reach a **$.61M Thurs** compared to WH:IWDWS.  (**Things to Note:** There were Wednesday previews that will be accounted for later.)  Not great.  To make matters worse, the WOM is not fairly favorable.  Friday is not looking much better with an estimated **$.98M** opening compared to WH:IWDWS.  While the theater capacities are rather low, Theater 2 is clearly taking the lead as this type of film is that locations bread and butter.  You can blame the poor marketing, lack of awareness, or simply, the Winehouse story isn't ready to be told right now.  Either way, this is no Bob Marley.  Amy deserves better.

Overall, this brings **IF** to a¬†**$10.76M** Th+F opening. For¬†**The Strangers: Chapter 1**, audiences are entering cinemas towards a Th+Fri¬†**$6.28M** opening. Left on the cutting room floor,¬†**Back to Black**¬†is looking at a¬†**$1.84M Pre+Thurs+Fri** opening.¬† If these numbers hold, IF is facing a **$31M** OW.  For an original title, this is an absolute win.  If only Paramount didn't spend...**$110M???**  What the hell are you thinking??  No wonder you're on the verge of shuttering your gates.  For The Strangers: Chapter 1, and estimated OW of **$16M** would be a borderline break-out, but is exceptional against its **$8.5M** price-tag.  Even if the title collapses, they already filmed the complete trilogy for release this year, so you better get used to these faces.  As part of the leftovers, Back to Black is looking at the single digits with a **$4** OW.  Just put this title out of its misery.  Clearly, audiences don't have a lack of offerings this week as we march into not only the Summer season, but Memorial Day next weekend.

TLDR:

**IF:**

Thursday:¬†**$2.19M**

Friday:¬†**$8.27M**

Opening Day:¬†**$10.76M**



**The Strangers: Chapter 1:**

Thursday:¬†**$1.23M**

Friday:¬†**$5.05M**

Opening Day:¬†**$6.28M - expect lower**



**Back to Black:**

Previews:¬†**$.25M**

Thursday: **$.61M**

**Sample Reviews:**

Megalopolis is anything but lazy, and while so many of the ideas don‚Äôt pan out as planned, this is the kind of late-career statement devotees wanted from the maverick, who never lost his faith in cinema. - Peter Debruge, Variety

I can‚Äôt say I was always engaged over its two hours-plus run time, but I was always curious about where it was going next. Is it a good movie? Not by a long stretch. But it‚Äôs not one that can be easily dismissed, either. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter

Once you let go of the understandable dream of Coppola returning with another masterpiece, there is much to enjoy in Megalopolis, especially its cast members, leaning into their moments with an abandon that was probably a job requirement. - Joshua Rothkopf, Los Angeles Times

It‚Äôs hard to believe the same brilliant director who made The Godfather, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now also birthed this monstrosity, which is wrong in so many ways, from its insipid screenplay and terrible direction to its bizarre casting. **1/4** \- Peter Howell, Toronto Star

This is a passion project without passion: a bloated, boring and bafflingly shallow film, full of high-school-valedictorian verities about humanity‚Äôs future. **2/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, Guardian

This is 138 stultifying minutes of ill-conceived themes, half-finished scenes, nails-along-the-blackboard performances, word-salad dialogue and ugly visuals all seemingly in search of a story that isn‚Äôt there. **1/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

Aubrey Plaza, whose character is a trashy TV news personality called Wow Platinum, has the measure of the thing better than anyone bar Coppola himself: she‚Äôs fantastic... **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

Perhaps the kindest thing one can say about Megalopolis is that it will probably remain largely unwatched and be quickly forgotten. **1/5** \- Raphael Abraham, Financial Times

Imagine a Paco Rabanne perfume ad mixed with the voyeuristic lady-gazing of a Sorrentino film and that will give you a whiff of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs latest ‚Äì and almost definitely last ‚Äì film. **1/5** \- Jo-Ann Titmarsh, London Evening Standard

Ultimately, this isn‚Äôt the car crash it could have been. It is, though, deeply flawed and very eccentric. **3/5** \- Geoffrey Macnab, Independent (UK)

Seconds, minutes, hours and (it seems, anyway) days assert their presence unforgivingly as the film staggers its way to nowhere worth going. If you don‚Äôt enjoy the first five minutes than gird your loins. It‚Äôs like that all the way through. **1/5** \- Donald Clarke, Irish Times

In parts, very occasionally, you get the kind of soaring Shakespearean feeling that the very best dramas have, and even though no one actually spouts this famous speech, you can feel the director‚Äôs exhortation to friends-Romans-countrymen. - Shubhra Gupta, The Indian Express

It's like listening to someone tell you about the crazy dream they had last night ‚Äì and they don't stop talking for well over two hours. **1/5** \- Nicholas Barber, BBC.com

What does it all mean? It‚Äôs clear that Coppola is feeling some anguish over the way certain honorable American ideals‚Äîessentially human ideals‚Äîhave become distorted and warped, maybe even discarded altogether. - Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine

This is the junkiest of junk-drawer movies, a slapped together hash of Coppola‚Äôs many disparate inspirations. What really tanks the movie, though, is its datedness. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

It is exactly the movie that Coppola set out to make -- uncompromising, uniquely intellectual, unabashedly romantic, broadly satirical yet remarkably sincere about wanting not just brave new worlds but better ones. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

Megalopolis might be the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. And I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt enjoy every single batshit second of it. - Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture

Megalopolis is stymied by arbitrary plotting and numbing excess. One can feel Coppola‚Äôs anger and sorrow over the decline of his beloved America, but narrative coherence is far less apparent. - Tim Grierson, Screen International

A work of art that actively practices what it preaches, a celebration of unfettered creativity and farsightedness that offers a volcanic fusion of hand-crafted neo-classicism while running through a script of toe-tapping word-jazz. - David Jenkins, Little White Lies

Megalopolis is stilted, earnest, over the top, CGI ridden, and utterly a mess. And yet you can picture a crowded theater shouting along with Jon Voight as he says in one key scene, ‚ÄúWhat do you make of this boner I got?‚Äù - Esther Zuckerman, The Daily Beast

With Megalopolis, \[Francis Ford Coppola\] crams 85 years worth of artistic reverence and romantic love into a clunky, garish, and transcendently sincere manifesto about the role of an artist at the end of an empire. **B+** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

A bunch of ideas smashed together into a garish, baffling, dazzling, kind of atrocious, and totally audacious rejection of the cinematic form. It should never have been made. And yet, now that it has, we should be so grateful that it exists. - Hoai-Tran Bui, Inverse

""Megalopolis"" is exactly what movies can and should be‚Äîunflinchingly earnest. - Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

Megalopolis is a Roman Epic fable set in an imagined Modern America.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Back to Black Thursday Comps/Predictions: $0.35M/$0.37M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.35M Thursday comp.  Probably looking at EA around $100k from these numbers, it's limited to Dolby only though so it's quite tiny (May 15). Yikes bikes (May 12).)

- crazymoviekid ($0.39M Thursday and $1.21M Friday comp. We're back up to $.3M-$.5M Thursday while Friday is pretty consistent, still around $1.15M-$1.4M. Estimated OW: $4.5M-$5.5M (May 16). Knocking this down to $.25M Thursday. Despite relatively strong sales, comps are low around $1.25M for Friday (May 15). Not great. Let's say $.3M (May 14).)

- el sid ($0.38M Thursday comp. Average tomorrow will probably be around 400k (May 15).)

- filmlover (Looking at the sales even for the early shows on Wednesday it's on the anemic side (and nothing that's likely to boost it over the next days). Feels like we're about to see how low a biopic about a famous musician can go (May 10).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.38M Thursday comp.)

- Relevation ($0.26M Thursday comp. And for how shitty IF did, Back to Black cratered even harder, and likely would've been the worst selling movie I've ever tracked had I not run numbers a little late. Sub-$300K THU and a $2.5-4M OW (May 15).)

- Rorschach (Zero tickets sold on Thursday and only four on Friday. I don't think I'll be missing much (May 13).)

**IF Thursday Comps/Predictions: $1.72M/$1.80M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.5M Thursday comp. Really good update here, FINALLY! Been waiting for this. This is encouraging for sure. With this growth now maybe shooting for a finish near 1.75 or maybe even approach 2. | Eek. Zero sales day only a few days before previews, when you're dealing with a very low baseline. I'm not sure what's happening here (May 15). Most comps did move the right direction. If it keeps trending up perhaps I can see a finish around $1.5M Thursday. One thing to peep at: the MTC1 ratio (59%) is unusually large compared to other family releases. At T-2, other releases' MTC1 % was at: KFP4: 51%, Migration: 34%, Wonka: 59%, Wish: 35%, Trolls: 24%. So much more comparable to Wonka and KFP4; maybe something to think about when looking at keyser's numbers and thinking of the ratio there (May 14). My model has been pretty good for animated/family releases in the past, hence why every comp is so eerily similar. Still, looking at others' numbers and how much lower mine are, I am wondering if summer break might be something to consider here; from what I am aware, here in Minnesota most school districts don't start break until June (May 13). Hoping for some real acceleration this last week but not looking good (May 12). One week out, not impressed in the slightest (May 9). Rising against comps as expected, due to the short release window, but I am still failing to see anything that suggests the numbers given by some other outlets (May 5).)

- AniNate (All I can say is if you look at Tinseltown Canton presales the IF projections ($30M+) seem pretty reasonable. I will grant they might've booked more screens than necessary for it (May 16). I'm gonna guess that Nick IP spot for IF this morning ratcheted up interest, Fri-Sun sales at Canton now close to 200.  Also of those 200 about 50 were for XD. Not the usual overwhelming presale split but not insignificant for a kids movie also playing on two standard screens (May 13). 45 sold at the five nearest Cinemarks for Thursday previews so far, so yeah there's evidently some kind of regional variation (May 13). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11). I dunno, I have no comps but I feel like local presales is a pretty sizable haul a week in advance for an original non-Disney kids movie (May 9).)

- crazymoviekid ($2.43M Thursday and $8.49M Friday comp. Not a great day.  Back down to $1.75M-$2M Thursday but pretty good day for Friday, bumping up to $7M-$7.5M. Estimate OW: $27M-$29M (May 16). Comps mostly are up. Adjusting up to around $2M-$2.25M Thursday. Unless this plays like Elemental, we're aiming around $6.5M-$7M Friday. Estimated OW: $25M-$27M (May 15). Definitely looking around $1.75M Thursday for now (May 14). 

- DAJK (Selling pretty well so far here (May 4).)

- el sid ($2.4M Thursday comp. Friday up so-so 116% since last Monday. I chose Jungle Cruise, Dolittle, Elemental, Minions 2 and Sonic 2 as comps (always counted on Monday of the release week for Friday) and the true Friday number for IF would be 6.6M at the moment. In this case the comparison numbers were very similar, around 6-7M. Overall it was a boring counting today which lasted too long for so few action. And judging from some random samples Garfield also saw no significant jumps (I also didn't expect much, it's still too early IMO). | Thursday up 92% since last Monday. I hoped for a bit better jump till today :( but it's also not too bad. | So for Friday no big numbers but up 75% since last Monday (and the jump must have happened pretty recently) (May 13). Up 73.5% since Monday (where it had 143 sold tickets). Best sales in California, not doing too bad between the coasts. The number today is ok to me (May 12). Not really signs for a breakout for Friday so far, but very solid. It will not really get 4-6M Thursday e.g. compared to Migration but from most comps the number could be pretty decent (May 7). Looked good for the film, both on Thursday and on Friday (May 6).)

- jeffthehat ($1.90M Thursday comp. Slipped a little vs. comps. Sub-20% growth seems bad at this stage and opening size for a family film. But maybe walkups are better than presales suggest. Thinking $1.8m +/- $0.2m tomorrow (May 15).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.62M Combined SizeAdjusted+GrowthModel Thursday comp. $1.50M Santikos Thursday comp. Sticking to the 1.5m - 1.75m range.  I'm looking for a +40% final day that would finish at 1.8m avg comps and 1.62m growth forecast.  I'm not ruling out 2m, but it would need to have a very good day (May 16).  Raising my expectations to 1.5 - 1.75m range.  I don't really have a good feel for what age this is playing to (May 15). Thinking somewhere in the 1.2m-1.5m Thursday range despite a couple of higher comps (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (Friday pace is promising (May 16). Dont think even if it doubles the gross, 2m is locked. But even if it does, it would barely do that much. Let us see how walkups go tomorrow. | Pace is really meh for T-2.  $1.75m ish for previews. OW should be similar to what I saw yesterday for now (May 15). I would say it should hit 2m previews or even more if walkups are strong. OW probably in mid to high 20s for now. Its Friday sales are not that much higher than thursday for crazy IM like say Panda 4 (May 14).)

- Relevation ($1.18M Thursday comp. IF completely tanked here, brutal comp average with no good comparisons at all. $1.2-1.5M THU and something in the ballpark of an $18-24M OW? (May 15).)

- RichWS (15 screen theater near me is giving IF peak Marvel number of showings. I know it's short and the market is quiet, but damn (May 14).)

- Rorschach (Good growth for IF, especially after Tuesday's abysmal sales (May 15). Even with no comps to go off, this growth seems pretty weaksauce. I guess we'll see how it goes tomorrow (May 14).)

- Shawn Robbins (The pre-sales I'm seeing in multiple markets are little better than I think some expect here. I wouldn't be shocked with a number between 2 and 2.5 for Thursday, as well as big jumps on Friday and Saturday. The flip side of that coin is the reviews... although kids won't care. Could see 40 happening if this plays super strong in family markets and outside coastal cities like I suspect it could, but I'm surprised the studio didn't low ball it a little more to be safe... especially since we had been very publicly keeping our range in the high 20s/low 30s from the bottom end (May 15).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.39M Thursday comp.  Really not much going on. Don't think walkups will be super strong either (May 13). Not much growth (May 10). Pace is collapsing a bit. Continues its downward trend (May 7). After a strong start, this has cooled off quite a bit (May 4).)

- Tinalera (Pretty quiet Vancouver and Calgary area (May 13).)

- vafrow ($0.6M Thursday comp.  Well, we finally got something. It still lags behind comps, and if I could be bothered to track walk ups, I'm guessing this will do okay. But it's still lagging some very reasonable comps by a large margin here (May 16). It's going up, but slowly. The thing that hit me looking at the numbers is that the most popular format so far is the VIP theatres, which are 19+. With such low sales, you can't read too much into anything, but it kind of speaks to how this isn't grabbing the family crowd (May 14). Some marginal movement, but we're running out of time for this.  At this stage, I expect my market is an anomaly, but I still hope and expect it will close the gap in the final few days (May 13). Still nothing (May 12). Still nothing happening. I did check Friday sales, and it was a lot stronger with 51 tickets sold. That's better, but still not tremendous. I also checked the wider radius, where it's pretty much exactly where Haunted Mansion was, which hit $3.1M opening (May 11). Still nothing really happening here (May 10). Since the last update, they released full showtime sets, and it actually lost two showtimes rather than gain. From the sound of it, it might be doing better in other Canadian markets, particularly BC (May 8). Numbers are still really low, making the standard track fairly useless. I did do a larger 100km radius track, encompassing the broader southern Ontaro market (~8M population, MTC4 being about 70-80% of the market). Even against Haunted Mansion, which underindexed here, it's not doing well (May 4).)

- YM! (So far in the four Wisconsin theaters I‚Äôve tracked, IF is at about 45% of where Wish was at in the two theaters I‚Äôve tracked 30 minutes before previews. Think it could get to something similar before preview time (May 16).)

**The Strangers: Chapter 1 Thursday Comps/Predictions: $1.49M/$1.37M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1M Thursday comp. Perhaps this will follow the Nun and the Exorcist comps, but I am not fully convinced. I'll just go with the average here and call it a day with my prediction: $1 Million, +/- 0.2.  | Not much movement here (May 15). Not a good update at all but I am wondering about the summer break deal here as well. For Back to Black it shouldn't affect it much I would think (May 13).)

- crazymoviekid ($1.24M Thursday and $4.35M Friday comp. Decent day. Feeling an inch past $1.25M Thursday but much better comps for Friday, aiming now between $4M-$5M. Estimated OW: $14M-$17M (May 16). Comps leveling off. Adjusting up to $1M Thursday and wouldn't trust Friday comp ($10.05M) (May 15). Weird comps. Let's go for $.5M-$.75M Thursday comp.)

- el sid ($1.9M Thursday comp. Nice surprise. Up very nice 67.5% since Monday (May 15). From what I saw, it had an ok jump till today but the jump till Wednesday will be way more important. But so far, decent presales (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.54M Combined SizeAdjusted+GrowthModel Thursday comp. $1.82M Santikos Thursday comp. Keeping on track to match IF tonight (May 16). We could have a preview battle on our hands! (May 14).)

- Relevation ($1.85M Thursday comp. The Strangers: Chapter One sold surprisingly well here, even somehow knocking IF for best selling movie of the weekend. Comps are hovering in the $1.5-2.2M range and I don't have a clue how walkups play here, but I suppose the $1.85M THU average my comps spit out sounds pretty right, combined with a $15Mish OW (May 15).)

- Rorschach ($1.09M/$4.68M/$5.23M Thursday/Friday/Thursday+Friday comp. Decent day for Strangers. Didn't quite continue off yesterday's big bump, but still holding well against the Tarot comp (May 15). More than double from yesterday's count. Curious to see if it keeps up the momentum going forward (May 14). Tarot had more tickets sold for Thursday compared to its Friday showings when I checked the Monday before it came out; hence, why the comps are so all over the place at the moment. The Thurs + Fri comp does appear to be a reasonable middle ground (May 13).)

- TwoMisfits (TMobile deal for May - $5 ticket to The Strangers Chapter 1 next Tuesday (May 9).)

**Furiosa Thursday Comp: $4.31M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.46M Thursday comp. GxK obviously really propping the average up but for now I could see that settling at around $5 Million, still good pace! (May 12). Really good stuff in this market (May 9). Reallyyyyyy good day 1 here. I want to note that: NO I do NOT think preview numbers will be that high; it's just highlighting the fact that this is likely a movie that will be running hot in my market, as cinephile blockbusters usually do. Next update I will have T-14 comps, which will be a lot lower due to the short release window (May 8).)

- AniNate (Encouraging to see the weekend fill out a bit. Been seeing a lot of promotion during the basketball playoffs so general awareness has to be getting there now. (May 15). Skimmed through Thur/Fri and Valley View (Cleveland vicinity) has sold roughly 60 Furiosa tix so far while Tinseltown (Canton) has sold 40. I'm guessing the upfront audience does lean more toward the urban/cosmopolitan sensibilities (May 9). Presales show there's definitely some hype for this. Regal gonna irritate trackers again, offering no upcharge IMAX for Furiosa (May 8).)

- Charlie Jatinder ($3.05M Thursday comp.)

- el sid ($5.8M average Thursday comp (without Exorcist 2) (May 12). Furiosa continues its strong performance in ""my"" theaters. The movie yesterday had already 1.310 sold tickets (for Thursday, May 23). Up 15% in ca. 24 hours which isn't bad at all after the first rush.  Already comfortably in front of The Fall Guy's final sales (it had 1.071 counted on Thursday for Thursday) and almost on par with Civil War's final sales (1.357) and also the Apes finally had not more than 1.657 sold tickets in my theaters (May 11). I also can't complain about Furiosa's presales in my theaters, not at all. Already 1,138 sold tickets (in all of ""my"" 7 theaters) for May 23. 14 days left. Promising start. Civil War on Thursday of the release week for Thursday had 1,357 sold tickets and The Fall Guy finally had 1,071 sold tickets (May 9).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.51M Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Definitely chugging along. I am feeling good about 5m+ previews (May 15). It has way stronger sales than Garfield and that is expected. I am thinking of 5m previews for now (May 14). I think this is a solid OD presales. With a short PS window its probably looking at 5m+ previews (May 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.44M Thursday comp. Keeps climbing at a strong pace (May 11). This continues to grow at an excellent rate (May 10). Really strong day 2. The short presales is for sure a factor (May 9). Not seeing much of a breakout. Still pretty solid start to presales (May 8).)

- vafrow ($2.9M Thursday comp. Comps are showing as steady since the last update, but it actually dipped quite a bit this week before rebounding today. Advance ticket buying has been so off in this market recently for some reason. Holding pace with Apes is a good sign (May 16). It had a good day (May 12). Mediocre day 2 (May 10). Not the hottest start. IMAX is the format of choice though, so, ATP will be high (May 9).)

**Hit Man**

- vafrow (Getting a theatrical release up here in Canada, and early signs are that it might get a pretty decent screen count. Not super wide or anything, but a pretty decent amount for a weekend that has a lot of other releases (May 14).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.24M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.76M EA comp and $1.19M Thursday comp.  Still not really accelerating, and the EA is falling against comps (May 12). Good EA numbers, but many of these comps were PLF-only EA, which this is not, so I think the ATP will be quite lower and that should be adjusted for (May 9).)

- AniNate (EA sales look decent now, but this does feel rather weak compared to the IF presales. Not 100% certain what's going on here but based on this I buy the trades' opening estimates over the forum vibes (May 15). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11).)

- el sid (The very even sales are a good sign (May 7). For Sunday, May 19, I can already report that also in my theaters it looks very good for Garfield. They will for sure add shows soon. It has so far only 1 show/theater and the shows are almost sold out, between 1 and 4 seats are still available. So my guess still is that this movie if it's not totally bad (and first reviews here were quite positive) will become a (big) hit. Seems not much on Thursday but it's a step in the right direction (May 6).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.52M EA+Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Its definitely weaker than even Elemental. That said these movies tend to finish strong and so I am not  writing it off so early. Just that the long PS window is irrelevant for them. They could rather start presales like a week before release and it would be all the same. | Meh. We have to wait until next week to gauge where its going to finish. It has very low ATP as well and actual would be even lower as its going to see tons of kids tickets (May 14). Early shows are regular digital shows at 1PM this sunday. So ATP will be very low. I think 500k ish at best. Preview let us see how things go in the final week. Presales at this point are almost non existent (May 13).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.14M Thursday comp.)

- vafrow ($0.4M Thursday comp. Comps don't paint a pretty picture though. EA shows are doing okay (May 11). Still no sales for my core sample for previews. But I did the larger sweep, which shows the interest right now is the Sunday early access shows. Looking at sales patterns, it's mainly blocks of 3/4 tickets, so likely families grabbing some. It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $8.14M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.67M Thursday comp. Holy numbers of shows and seats! Multiplexes are really expecting a lot here. Sales off the bat not amazing here sadly, but we shall see where it goes (May 15).)

- AniNate (It is encouraging that Canton is already giving me something to work with with 12 Thursday preview sales. Same number for Fri-Sun. | I do see nine sales for first Thursday at Canton now and I think that's a pretty solid start (May 15). I do see a few 1-2 spots for Inside Out on Saturday. Think some M-F workweek adult fans might be putting down money for that (May 14).)

- charlie Jatinder ($11.84M Thursday comp at MTC2. $16M Thursday comp for Kung Fu Panda 4 (May 15).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Already at 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  For comparison, Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (At least the show counts show Plexes are expecting a big OW. I dont remember when we last had a animation movie start with so many shows. I wont count Mario as that was a fan driven movie. | Definitely not great presales but this is not a fan driven movie. Let us see where things are in the final week (May 15). Too early to judge presales as ticket sales just started early this morning. Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective its way bigger than all animation movies seen recently including Panda 4. Easily the biggest I have seen in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (VERY BAD COMPS: $8.83M Thursday comp.  I really do not have good comps for this movie.  Like, at all.  Especially for D1. With that in mind, I did some digging and did manage to get the Elemental D1 numbers out of the old Tracking thread: IO2 = 5.45946x Elemental on D1 [13.10m]. Now will Inside Out 2 be as backloaded as Elemental?  Well it's tough to literally sell 5.5x times the amount of tickets on the final couple of days that Elemental did, so perhaps not.  But it does show how fracking backloaded purely kids animation is. Anyway, this is 30 days out and it isn't a CBM film (like AtSV) or CBM-adjacent film (like Incredibles 2).  The Sonic 2 comp is perhaps a little concerning.  On the other hand, nearly a weeks more of pre-sales so not exactly a great comp. 3.5% of presales are 3D and 40.1% are PLF (May 15). On the Saturday of release weekend (ie NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost the OW slightly, depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister ($8.20M Thursday comp. This is a super super strong day 2. Probably just Orlando overindexing, but yeah starting to lean towards something big brewing. Florida presales are somehow even crazier. Sold 2357 seats and is getting a blockbuster rollout in terms of showing allocations. Kung Fu panda comp day 2: gives me $8.50M  (May 15). Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for Thursday (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for Thursday (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for Thursday at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base Thursday rush... (May 14).)

- vafrow (No new sales. Whatever glitches in the system on day 1 didn't push sales to day 2. I still think the lack of base ticket options will push families to wait. Cineplex has jacked up the cost of premium formats, plus they're throwing in an increase for opening weekend of major releases. It adds up quickly for families (May 16). With the site glitching yesterday, it might account for the slow start. But, what's interesting is the format breakdown. Nothing is being made available in anything close to a regular showtime. The one non 3D showing in Dolby is a matinee showing. Everything else is carrying a hefty premium.  They'll likely release regular showtimes closer to release, but right now, it's priced to get eager fans to pay the premium formats (May 15).)

- YM! (In fairness it's only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a Thursday. It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

#**Daily Box Office (May 16th 2024)**
 
The market hits ¬•30.5M/$4.2M which is down -7% versus yesterday and down -29% versus last week.

**Fall Guy** is heading for a massive flop in China. Just $62k in pre-sales for its opening day is some of the worst numbers i've see in a while. Lower than The Little Mermaid($129k). Lower than Indy($170k) and not even close to the $258k of Shazam 2 or$418k of Dungeons and Dragons. Not unexpected but there were people who thought this could do $15M+ in China just a few weeks ago. Although that was before it got delayed out of the Holiday period although even that probably could save it looking at these numbers.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**520 Day(May 20th):**

The 20th of May is seen by many as an unofficial Valentines Day. Which means a lot of romance/drama coming out to make use of the date. Given its linked to a weekend this year many are using the chance to release as early as Friday to then link it to the Monday.

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_strangers_chapter_1) Rotten

**Critics Consensus:** Lacking the chilling suspense of the original *The Strangers* and proving to be just unpleasant, this *Chapter 1* closes the book on itself.

[**Metacritic:**](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-strangers-chapter-1/) 44 (19 Reviews)

**Sample Reviews:**

Time will tell, but for now there‚Äôs enough reason for devotees of the series to be cautiously optimistic ‚Äî and even a little curious ‚Äî about the next two chapters. - Michael Nordine, Variety

The Strangers: Chapter 1 is everything WRONG with the horror genre. - Valerie Complex, Deadline Hollywood Daily

It‚Äôs a pat retread of all the violence from the original film, with no emotional investment and no creativity in the mayhem department. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap

The hapless script ‚Äî written by Alan R. Cohen and Alan Freedland and based on the original ‚Äî offers nothing fresh in a tiring 91 minutes, and nothing daring to justify a new ‚ÄúStrangers‚Äù film, let alone a new series... - Erik Piepenburg, New York Times

The original ‚ÄúStrangers‚Äù made the walk to the parking lot after feel weird, or inspired some securing of doors and windows at home. Not so with the rote stylings of the new film. - Mark Olsen, Los Angeles Times

For what it is, ‚ÄúThe Strangers: Chapter 1‚Äù isn‚Äôt bad. What‚Äôs bad is what it is. **2/4** \- Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle

‚ÄúThe Strangers: Chapter 1‚Äù is a well-paced, 91-minute thrill ride that provides a steady helping of jump scares while ending on a note that has us eagerly anticipating the next chapters in the saga. **3.5/4** \- Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times

The original was a tightly wound nail biter, full of looming dread, but this one runs on fumes: there's no tension or atmosphere, just recycled beats from the original, played like a cheap cover song. **D-** \- Adam Graham, Detroit News

The charms and limitations of ‚ÄúThe Strangers: Chapter 1‚Äù are proportionate to pretty much cancelling the movie out entirely. **2.5/4** \- Adam Nayman, Toronto Star

While definitely an easy watch, Harlin‚Äôs film will leave fans of the original wanting more than Chapter 1‚Ä≤s somewhat uninspired and par-for-the-course delivery. - Sarah-Tai Black, Globe and Mail

There‚Äôs something almost contemptuous about it all, a ‚Äúthis will do, right?‚Äù shrug of a thing that audiences should instantly reject with a loud ‚Äúno, it won‚Äôt‚Äù. **2/5** \- Benjamin Lee, Guardian

Whereas Bertino‚Äôs original was sleek, sinister and deft, this do-over is noisy, dull and dumb as a bag of rocks. - Nick Schager, The Daily Beast

Yes, the masks are great. And yes, home invasions will aways be scary. But when it comes to messing with genre classics, your answer to ‚ÄúWhy remake a near-perfect film?‚Äù can‚Äôt be ‚ÄúIt was here.‚Äù **C+** \- Alison Foreman, indieWire

Harlin‚Äôs film thinks it's ""improving"" on the original by filling in blanks that are blank for a reason, scrubbing away what The Strangers fans hold dear about Bertino‚Äôs remarkably revolting mirror to humanity. **2.5/5** \-  Matt Donato, Inverse

This film‚Äôs approach to slasher film mayhem is liable to induce some serious d√©j√† vu. **1.5/4** \- Mark Hanson, Slant Magazine

Chapter 1 doesn‚Äôt establish enough of its own identity to make it memorable or set it apart, but it‚Äôs just functional enough to raise curiosity for where we‚Äôre headed next. **2.5/5** \- Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting

Once we're able to see Harlin's new trilogy as a whole, ‚ÄúChapter 1‚Äù might feel more essential to the 4.5-hour experience. Right now, it just feels overly familiar. **2/4** \- Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

After their car breaks down in an eerie small town, a young couple (Madelaine Petsch and Froy Gutierrez) are forced to spend the night in a remote cabin.

Panic ensues as they are terrorized by three masked strangers who strike with no mercy and seemingly no motive in THE STRANGERS ‚Äï CHAPTER 1, the chilling first entry of this upcoming horror feature film series.

These films have either flopped or under-performed and I'm wondering why. 

Most of these movies actually got good reviews. It's pretty ironic that the worst of the bunch, Tarot, will end up making the most profit but only because it's the cheapest one. 

How in the heck did Abigail cost 28 million? Horror movies shouldn't be mid-budgeted, part of the genre's success is how low the budget it, so even if a movie only makes 10 mill on OW, it made its money back (or broke even).",102,58

As well as cross referencing my findings with the average national movie theater ticket price and dividing by the gross etc. 

I was looking at Spider-Man movies, avengers movies, Star Wars, Superman, and Batman. It was then I discovered some interesting things. 

Batman basically sold the same amount of tickets if not just a littleeeee more than man of steel. Which is impressive considering it got HBO max sacrificed very early and was coming off of Covid. Another thing is that it sold a decent amount more tickets than Batman begins. But failed to sell as many tickets as the first Burton Batman movie. It did however sell more tickets than any Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movie. It‚Äôs unclear if it sold as many tickets as Batman forever and Batman Returns. The Batman comes in higher with the us inflation calculator. But lower if you divide the 1992/1995 ticket prices by returns/forever gross. Kinda strange. 

But what was really eye opening was to match The Dark Knight, The Batman would‚Äôve had to do like ~750M-800M+ domestic. Batman 2 in 2026 I can‚Äôt even imagine it‚Äôll probably need at least 800M domestic minimum to be as successful as the dark knight was relative to 08. Even matching Rises it would need like 650M domestic. Both of these seem out of reach for the Reeves trilogy entirely. I doubt we‚Äôll ever see Batman hit those highs ever again if we‚Äôre talking admissions. ",154,234

[**Rotten Tomatoes:**](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/furiosa_a_mad_max_saga) Certified Fresh

**Critics Consensus:** Retroactively enriching *Fury Road* with greater emotional heft if not quite matching it in propulsive throttle, *Furiosa* is another glorious swerve in mastermind George Miller's breathless race towards cinematic Valhalla.

**Sample Reviews:**

It all adds up to is a movie that can be darkly bedazzling, and that will be embraced and defended in a dozen passionate ways -- but it‚Äôs one that, to me, falls very short of being a ‚ÄúMad Max‚Äù home run. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety

Anya Taylor-Joy is a fierce presence in the title role and Chris Hemsworth is clearly having fun as a gonzo Wasteland warlord, but the mythmaking lacks muscle, just as the action mostly lacks the visual poetry of its predecessor. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter

Miller is such a wildly inventive filmmaker that it‚Äôs been easy to forget that he keeps making movies about the end of life as we know it... It‚Äôs only with ‚ÄúFuriosa‚Äù that I now understand he‚Äôs also one kick-ass prophet of doom. - Manohla Dargis, New York Times

‚ÄúFuriosa,‚Äù to its distinction and detriment, ends up being too self-regarding, too downbeat. - Joshua Rothkopf, Los Angeles Times

‚ÄúThe question is,‚Äù Dementus asks, ‚Äúdo you have what it takes to make it epic?‚Äù Miller answers that question with a resounding yes. **4/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

It gets overwhelming at times, but it‚Äôs in service of a cinematic vision that continues to fascinate all these years and changes later. **3/4** \- Peter Howell, Toronto Star

Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth are a great pairing and Taylor-Joy is an overwhelmingly convincing action heroine. She sells this sequel. **4/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, Guardian

This is a film made with purposeful savagery, and with considerable wit and lyricism, too. It has the concentrated intensity of 2015‚Äôs Fury Road, to which it is a prequel, and yet it unfolds across a far broader canvas. **5/5** \- Geoffrey Macnab, Guardian

A thundering beginning and a searing sense of place fail to compensate for the wearisome repetition and empty theatrics that slowly swamp this much-awaited blockbuster. **2/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

It might not reach the heights of its predecessor, but Furiosa is a furious ride with three utterly watchable leads. Taylor-Joy has done Charlize Theron proud as this fabulous vengeful heroine. **4/5** \- Jo-Ann Titmarsh, London Evening Standard

The film may handle differently to its predecessor, but it‚Äôs clearly been tuned by the same engineers. After the pared-down drag racer, here comes the juggernaut. **5/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

All the bits and pieces are there to continue this landmark series but the outcome result fails to leave an impression. It lacks oomph. **3/5** \- Stephen Romei, The Australian

It gets so busy with all the revving, and the roaring, and the non-stop decimation of faceless computer-generated creatures, that you feel completely uninvolved. And unmoved. I couldn‚Äôt wait for it to get over. - Shubhra Gupta, The Indian Express

You soon reach the point where you're sick of sand, sick of explosions, sick of off-puttingly sadistic violence, and sick of thunderous drums bashing away on the soundtrack, and yet the film keeps piling on more and more and more of them. **3/5** \- Nicholas Barber, BBC.com

Despite its many, many action sequences, and a symphonic cacophony of motorbikes vrooming in the sand, the movie... evolves into a slog that‚Äôs working hard to persuade us we‚Äôre having a good time, though it may not be actually giving us one. - Stephanie Zacharek, TIME Magazine

Furiosa runs on a high-octane philosophical perspective that finds hope in a hopeless place. Also, a lot of cars go fast and shit blows up. It‚Äôs a win-win. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

Furiosa is a fine prelude to that mighty arc. Its initial rattling gradually gives way to the robust and satisfying purr of Miller, despite everything, making it work. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

Action sequences charge forward and build and build, casually leaving all manner of bodies in their wake. - Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture

The chassis may look familiar but there is a very different engine driving Furiosa from that of Fury Road: it‚Äôs a rich, sprawling epic that only strengthens and deepens the Max-mythology. It shall ride eternal! **5/5** \- John Nugent, Empire Magazine

While it‚Äôs absolutely a blast at the cinema, the dizzying heights that Miller drove us back in 2015 aren‚Äôt quite matched a second time around. **4/5** \- Hannah Strong, Little White Lies

The transition from the young Furiosa (played beautifully by Alyla Browne) to the mature adult (Taylor-Joy) is seamless, and connects well with the version we‚Äôve seen before, in the form of Theron. **4/5** \- Ed Gibbs, Time Out

It harkens back to the more sprawling nature of the original Mad Max films, but it‚Äôs also a spiritual work that grapples with how humanity reacts to grief and loss... all while delivering on the visual spectacle you could hope for from Miller. - Esther Zuckerman, The Daily Beast

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga doesn‚Äôt feel like an overture for the vehicular carnage of Fury Road so much as it retroactively makes Fury Road feel like a coda for the epic tale Miller tells here. **A-** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

This is Furiosa‚Äôs story, a legend made in two parts. It is Miller‚Äôs opus, honoring love and hope in its least likely setting. **A-** \- Tara Bennett, AV Club

Furiosa is a jaw-dropping achievement. It‚Äôs a hyper-realistic vision of the apocalypse, a Greek myth made into an outsized blockbuster spectacle. - Hoai-Tran Bui, Inverse

The film attests to George Miller‚Äôs enduring aptitude for utilizing the ridiculous to achieve the sublime. **3.5/4** \- Keith Uhlich, Slant Magazine

High on exhaust and the limitless capabilities of cinema, this no-brakes franchise keeps careening onward as if it could run forever. - Charles Bramesco, Decider

Furiosa is such a thrilling ride, packed with set pieces that are a masterclass in staging action, that it‚Äôs a little sad when the plot veers towards the events of the previous movie ‚Äî because we know that‚Äôs where the ride ends. **A** \- Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence

It‚Äôs hard to top perfection; it‚Äôs the reason why there‚Äôs no Citizen Kane, Too or Still Singin‚Äô in the Rain. - Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict

A big, entertaining popcorn movie, told with a sense of adventure and play.... ‚ÄúFuriosa‚Äù aims to blow you away. And it does. To Valhalla and beyond. **4/4** \- Robert Daniels, RogerEbert.com

Furiosa is utterly astounding in its technical precision, its cinematography and the performances of Taylor Joy and Hemsworth. - Kristen Lopez, Kristomania (Substack)

**SYNOPSIS:**

As the world fell, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falls into the hands of a great Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus. Sweeping through the Wasteland they come across the Citadel presided over by The Immortan Joe.

boxoffice,t3_1csquhs,1715794972.0,/r/boxoffice/comments/1csquhs/challengers_and_the_value_of_midbudget_films_in/,Original Analysis,"""Challengers"" and the value of midbudget films in 2024 ","Apologies ahead for what might be a bit of a rambly post, but I had a thought about box office that generally and I guess I wanted some feed back on weather or not I'm right or not.

So there's been a lot of analysis in the past few weeks about the merit of theatrically released original mid-budget movies, the kinds of movies that Hollywood ""Doesn't make anymore"". I want to center this idea around ""Challengers"" specifically as it's box office has felt like a rorschach test for it's box office, some people say that's it numbers are impressive for what it is, some people are saying that it's doing poorly considering it's nowhere near completing the 2.5x rule of thumb for it's box office considering it's 55 mil budget. Currently the movie is at 69.2 million (nice) and will probably get no where it's needed 137.5 million. Objectively, in many ways it's a flop. However a couple of things

1. It's by far the most successful erotic tennis drama of all time, not sure if there are literally any other movies in that sub-genre but it's still an achievement.
2. And much more importantly, Challengers domestic and international number have been solid and okay for a drama, combined with the fact that it's generated a ton of buzz on social media, this leads to one conclusion; Challengers is going to make a killing on streaming.

Challengers is going to be insanely big on VOD, and rentals, and it's going to get an insane amount of viewership when it comes to Prime Video, it might even be Amazon's biggest movie on there (though I'm not sure how much that would mean, I honestly can't name what movie might actually be Amazon's biggest release)

All of this is to say is that Challengers is probably going to make it's money back or at least break even by the time it's done. Which like, on it's own, who cares ? Plenty of movies make their money back later. Well it got me thinking about that oft quoted Matt Damon quote, when he was on Hot Ones, and was talking about why the types of movies Hollywood makes has changes

""Well what happened was the DVD was a huge part of out business, of our revenue stream, and technology has just made that obsolete. So the movies we used to make, you could afford to not make all of your money when it played in the theatre because you had the DVD coming behind the release and six months later you would get a whole 'nother chunk, it be like opening the movie again almost. And when that went away it changed the type of movies we would make.""

Why is this important, because, I would argue that Challengers is the exact type of movie Damon is talking about here. Challengers won't make it money back in theatres, theatrically it's a flop, but it's not a failure because theoretically that can be okay because it will make it money back down the line in Streaming/VOD.

Is this cope, possibly, I haven't seen Challengers, and am not invested in it's particular success but I'd like to see more movies like this succeed so in that way I am. My point in this is simply a desire to see more mid-budget films like Challengers in theatres and that maybe we just might be roping back around to how things were in the 80's and 90's when you sometimes you didn't have to make all of your money in theatres to make your money, and if true Hollywood could look at a movie like Challengers and decided that make more movies like it, not less.

Now I now there are couple of major caveats to my argument one being the smaller pie in general. Challengers is making significantly less, especially when you adjust for inflation, than adult dramas in the 80's and 90's made, AND worse still VOD and streaming probably isn't as profitable as DVD's and VHS's were, some of that is information not disclosed to the public so we don't know for sure, for sure, but we can surmise. So this isn't an everything is actually fine post. Hollywood still has a lot, like A LOT to do if wants to get back to where it was in the past if that's even possible

All I am is suggesting is an alternative way to look at things, and that this way of looking at the state of the box office, could mean that we end up with more unique and interesting theatrical releases and not less.

TL;DR - Hollywood might be going full circle back to the days of DVD's and VHS's with streaming now and this could still lead to more mid-budget theatrical releases like Challengers.

Addendum - A couple of other first though, A) Is VOD different from when Damon was talking about it ? That video was only from 2 years ago, but I believe Damon was talking about the general transition from DVD to Netflix in the early 2000's to 2010's. These were messy transitional years from Hollywood with a massive emphasize on simply subscribing to streaming services. PVOD is faster now as well as streaming hits like Saltburn proving to be MASSIVE for these services though it's impossible to tell just how much money a movie like that generated for Amazon since no one subscribes to a service like that for one movie, I have a feeling that Amazon and Netflix would rather have massive hits like that than not. This leads to my second important point

B) Challengers had to be in theatres to achieve whatever success it might have. While plenty of streaming exclusive movies do well, a lot of the MASSIVE streaming hits tend to be theatrical releases. Challengers couldn't have just gone to VOD or Netflix and been a hit, it's only the combination of a buzzy moderately successful theatrical release and then VOD/ streaming that any of this works. Okay bye now !",21,0

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**520 Day(May 20th):**

The 20th of May is seen by many as an unofficial Valentines Day. Which means a lot of romance/drama coming out to make use of the date. Given its linked to a weekend this year many are using the chance to release as early as Friday to then link it to the Monday.

I expected the presales for opening day to be bigger for both movies. Let's get into discussing results which I'm a lot better at doing!

The RoundUp Punishment: Slams dunks with an 80% increase from last Wednesday. 10 million admits is now in the rear view mirror.

Haikyuu: Has an excellent CGV score of 96 and a nice Naver score of 8.8! Should have solid legs even if it a front heavy anime movie. 

Garfield: Has an excellent score with a CGV of 95 and a 8.33 on Naver. Should have healthy legs. 

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: Had a sudden realization that it should have a good day as it increased by 89% from opening day. 

KP4: Great increase by a 143% from last Wednesday.

Challengers: A great 88% increase from last Wednesday! Breaks 500k dollars. 

Exhuma: A pretty forgettable 28% increase from last Wednesday.

Dune 2: is only 585 admits from hitting 2 million.

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of this film. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the one film for the week.

#**Inside Out 2**

The sequel to *Inside Out* (2015), the film is directed by Kelsey Mann (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein. It stars the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Diane Lane, and Kyle MacLachlan, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri, Ad√®le Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser, and Kensington Tallman. The film focuses on Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who are astonished when new emotions are introduced in Riley's mind.

Now that you've met this week's new release. Let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- *Inside Out* is one of Pixar's most beloved films from the 2010s onward, so there's already a built-in audience for the film.

- Despite having to compete with *Minions* a few weeks later, the film earned a massive $858 million worldwide. As previously said, it already has a huge built-in audience.

- The trailers and synopsis have offered a pretty intriguing look at the sequel: Riley growing up, and the addition of new emotions. So the film can avoid feeling repetitive compared to the original.

- Its sole animated competition by the time it hits theaters is *The Garfield Movie*, which will be 3 weeks old by that point. Considering the audience's familiarity with the film, there's a chance audiences prioritize *Inside Out 2* over *Garfield*.

- It's just one day, but so far, [the pre-sales look incredibly good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/comments/1csaqfz/domestic_bot_presale_tracking_may_14_total/) 

#**CONS**

- Pixar and Disney have had an... underwhelming run ever since they returned to theaters in 2021. Pixar had a huge bomb with *Lightyear*, and while *Elemental* had great legs, it barely broke even at best. Disney, meanwhile, had it worse: *Encanto* underwhelmed at the box office before blowing up on streaming, *Strange World* was one of the biggest bombs in history, and *Wish* was another colossal bomb. *Inside Out 2* won't fare this badly, but it's a sign that their brands have taken a dive in the past years.

- The original's director and writer Pete Docter is not back in his roles. While it's unlikely audiences pay much attention to who is involved on an animated film, Docter's involvement in these two roles is usually a sign of guaranteed quality (*Monsters, Inc.*, *Up*, *Inside Out* and *Soul*). His only involvement was that the film would use his ""five to 27 emotions"" idea.

- The film will face *Despicable Me 4* three weeks later, which could eat into its family demographic.

And here's the past results.

**Critics Consensus:** A sweet ode to rediscovering one's inner child, *IF* largely works as old-fashioned family entertainment despite an occasionally unfocused and unnecessarily complicated plot.

**Sample Reviews:**

IF may be guilty of trying too hard, but it‚Äôs a refreshing change from so many family movies that barely seem to be trying at all. - Frank Scheck, Hollywood Reporter

IF wasn‚Äôt enough to keep my attention, how will it keep the attention of a child for 104 minutes?? - Valerie Complex, Deadline Hollywood Daily

It‚Äôs tonally discombobulated and nowhere near as enchanting as Michael Giacchino‚Äôs score seems to think it is. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap

When ‚ÄúIF‚Äù reaches its cathartic finale, some kiddos might be wondering why their parents are sniffling and tearing up ‚Äì if they're still paying attention and not off playing with their own imaginary friend by then. **2.5/4** \- Brian Truitt, USA Today

‚ÄúIF‚Äù is largely a bust ‚Äî a family film in search of an audience that it never convincingly finds. **2/4** \- Ty Burr, Washington Post

The movie is a disordered wreck that confuses impulse for inspiration and dissipates any impossibility of impact by constantly switching focus. **1/4** \- Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle

... The dialogue between Bea and other real-world characters tends toward the obvious. But among the IFs the movie slants toward something fresher ‚Äî if not absolute originality, then at least a dash of imagination. **2.5/5** \- Natalia Winkelman, Boston Globe

What is supposed to be a comedy develops into an honest film about coping with loss. **4/5** \- Dina Kaur, Arizona Republic

Bells and whistles and imaginary friends aside, it‚Äôs that message of the inner child that‚Äôs ultimately essential ‚Äì and If channels just enough of it for this viewer to, at least for a few moments, remember hers. 3/5 - Adrian Horton, Guardian

A children‚Äôs fantasy of wistful wonder and another satisfying chapter in the career of the actor/film-maker John Krasinski. **4/5** \- Ed Potton, Times (UK)

It‚Äôs all thumpingly corny, but in the way good family films often are. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

\[It\] isn‚Äôt so much a film but a series of emotional cues. It‚Äôs the same experience, really, as sitting down to watch an hour-and-a-half video loop of dogs being adopted. **2/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK)

Krasinski has invested a lot into a film of hardworking charm and loving human detail. All it needs now is some children to see it. **3/5** \- Danny Leigh, Financial Times

IF does make the case for finding the fun in life, but in a movie that needs to be more fun than it is. - Brian Lowry, CNN.com

Far from perfect in its execution, but once IF hits its stride, Reynolds and Fleming keep this emotional adventure entertaining enough. **3/5** \- Kelechi Ehenulo, Empire Magazine

We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening most of the time, and worst yet, we don‚Äôt know how to feel about it, no matter our age. That‚Äôs much more than a failure of just imagination. **C-** \- Kate Erbland, indieWire

What IF lacks is what it champions: the magical imagination of childhood. **4/10** \- A.A. Dowd, IGN Movies

A movie that loudly yells at audiences they need to have some fun, while not actually providing any fun itself. **3/10** \- Matt Singer, ScreenCrush

Krasinski's paper-thin script \[...\] gestures broadly at a kind of mechanical worldbuilding but soon throws its hands up in the air and greedily chases one heartstring after another. **1.5/4** \- Clint Worthington, RogerEbert.com

A heartfelt hit from Krasinski, with some carefully constructed chaos and a fine cast. Despite the occasional meandering, this is a fun family film that deserves to be a huge hit. **4/5** \- Linda Marric, HeyUGuys

It is a smudgy valentine, all heart, whimsy, and charm. If the message is a bit messy and the logic not quite sound, for me that was more than made up for by the tenderness. B+ - Nell Minow, Movie Mom

**SYNOPSIS:**

From writer and director John Krasinski, IF is about a girl who discovers that she can see everyone‚Äôs imaginary friends ‚Äî and what she does with that superpower ‚Äî as she embarks on a magical adventure to reconnect forgotten IFs with their kids.

Despite two wide openers, a horrible weekend ‚Ä¶ While¬†**Garfield**¬†has, at least, some potential to keep alive until summer holidays, the lates¬†**Planet of the Apes**¬†movie will not even have decent legs. The franchise was never that popular in Germany (the 2011 and 2014 releases topped out at >1mil, the 3rd one didn't reach 800k) but this will mark the lowest mark yet.

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Back to Black EA+Thursday Comp: $0.34M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.29M EA+Thursday comp.  Yikes bikes (May 12).)

- crazymoviekid ($0.28M Thursday comp. Not great. Let's say $.3M (May 14).)

- filmlover (Looking at the sales even for the early shows on Wednesday it's on the anemic side (and nothing that's likely to boost it over the next days). Feels like we're about to see how low a biopic about a famous musician can go (May 10).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.45M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Rorschach (Zero tickets sold on Thursday and only four on Friday. I don't think I'll be missing much (May 13).)

**IF Thursday comp *assuming $2M for keysersoze123*: $1.82M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.23M Thursday comp. My model has been pretty good for animated/family releases in the past, hence why every comp is so eerily similar. Still, looking at others' numbers and how much lower mine are, I am wondering if summer break might be something to consider here; from what I am aware, here in Minnesota most school districts don't start break until June (May 13). Hoping for some real acceleration this last week but not looking good (May 12). One week out, not impressed in the slightest (May 9). Rising against comps as expected, due to the short release window, but I am still failing to see anything that suggests the numbers given by some other outlets (May 5). The release window for this is way shorter than all these comps so those numbers will naturally go up. Decent growth in the last three days (May 2).)

- AniNate (I'm gonna guess that Nick IP spot for IF this morning ratcheted up interest, Fri-Sun sales at Canton now close to 200.  Also of those 200 about 50 were for XD. Not the usual overwhelming presale split but not insignificant for a kids movie also playing on two standard screens (May 13). 45 sold at the five nearest Cinemarks for Thursday previews so far, so yeah there's evidently some kind of regional variation (May 13). I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11). I dunno, I have no comps but I feel like local presales is a pretty sizable haul a week in advance for an original non-Disney kids movie (May 9). I did see a surprising amount of single sales looking at IF charts (May 1).)

- charlie Jatinder (Hmm. So no real Regal impact it seems at katnisscinnaplex's theaters (April 30).)

- crazymoviekid ($1.95M Thursday comp. Definitely looking around $1.75M Thursday for now (May 14). 

- DAJK (Selling pretty well so far here (May 4).)

- el sid ($2.4M Thursday comp. Friday up so-so 116% since last Monday. I chose Jungle Cruise, Dolittle, Elemental, Minions 2 and Sonic 2 as comps (always counted on Monday of the release week for Friday) and the true Friday number for IF would be 6.6M at the moment. In this case the comparison numbers were very similar, around 6-7M. Overall it was a boring counting today which lasted too long for so few action. And judging from some random samples Garfield also saw no significant jumps (I also didn't expect much, it's still too early IMO). | Thursday up 92% since last Monday. I hoped for a bit better jump till today :( but it's also not too bad. | So for Friday no big numbers but up 75% since last Monday (and the jump must have happened pretty recently) (May 13). Up 73.5% since Monday (where it had 143 sold tickets). Best sales in California, not doing too bad between the coasts. The number today is ok to me (May 12). Not really signs for a breakout for Friday so far, but very solid. It will not really get 4-6M Thursday e.g. compared to Migration but from most comps the number could be pretty decent (May 7). Looked good for the film, both on Thursday and on Friday (May 6).)

- jeffthehat ($2.07M Thursday comp.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.98M Thursday comp. Thinking somewhere in the 1.2m-1.5m Thursday range despite a couple of higher comps (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (I would say it should hit 2m previews or even more if walkups are strong. OW probably in mid to high 20s for now. Its Friday sales are not that much higher than thursday for crazy IM like say Panda 4 (May 14).)

- RichWS (15 screen theater near me is giving IF peak Marvel number of showings. I know it's short and the market is quiet, but damn (May 14).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.39M Thursday comp.  Really not much going on. Don't think walkups will be super strong either (May 13). Not much growth (May 10). Pace is collapsing a bit. Continues its downward trend (May 7). After a strong start, this has cooled off quite a bit (May 4).)

- Tinalera (Pretty quiet Vancouver and Calgary area (May 13).)

- vafrow ($0.5M Thursday comp.  It's going up, but slowly. The thing that hit me looking at the numbers is that the most popular format so far is the VIP theatres, which are 19+. With such low sales, you can't read too much into anything, but it kind of speaks to how this isn't grabbing the family crowd (May 14). Some marginal movement, but we're running out of time for this.  At this stage, I expect my market is an anomaly, but I still hope and expect it will close the gap in the final few days (May 13). Still nothing (May 12). Still nothing happening. I did check Friday sales, and it was a lot stronger with 51 tickets sold. That's better, but still not tremendous. I also checked the wider radius, where it's pretty much exactly where Haunted Mansion was, which hit $3.1M opening (May 11). Still nothing really happening here (May 10). Since the last update, they released full showtime sets, and it actually lost two showtimes rather than gain. From the sound of it, it might be doing better in other Canadian markets, particularly BC (May 8). Numbers are still really low, making the standard track fairly useless. I did do a larger 100km radius track, encompassing the broader southern Ontaro market (~8M population, MTC4 being about 70-80% of the market). Even against Haunted Mansion, which underindexed here, it's not doing well (May 4).)

**The Strangers: Chapter 1 Thursday Comp: $1.12M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.88M Thursday comp. Not a good update at all but I am wondering about the summer break deal here as well. For Back to Black it shouldn't affect it much I would think (May 13).)

- crazymoviekid ($1.23M Thursday comp. Weird comps. Let's go for $.5M-$.75M Thursday comp.)

- el sid ($1.6M Thursday comp. From what I saw, it had an ok jump till today but the jump till Wednesday will be way more important. But so far, decent presales (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.4M Thursday comp. We could have a preview battle on our hands! (May 14).)

- Rorschach ($0.48M/$6.03M/$4.16M Thursday/Friday/Thursday+Friday comp. Tarot had more tickets sold for Thursday compared to its Friday showings when I checked the Monday before it came out; hence, why the comps are so all over the place at the moment. The Thurs + Fri comp does appear to be a reasonable middle ground (May 13).)

- TwoMisfits (TMobile deal for May - $5 ticket to The Strangers Chapter 1 next Tuesday (May 9).)

**Furiosa Thursday Comp *assuming $5M For keysersoze123*: $4.31M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.46M Thursday comp. GxK obviously really propping the average up but for now I could see that settling at around $5 Million, still good pace! (May 12). Really good stuff in this market (May 9). Reallyyyyyy good day 1 here. I want to note that: NO I do NOT think preview numbers will be that high; it's just highlighting the fact that this is likely a movie that will be running hot in my market, as cinephile blockbusters usually do. Next update I will have T-14 comps, which will be a lot lower due to the short release window (May 8).)

- AniNate (Skimmed through Thur/Fri and Valley View (Cleveland vicinity) has sold roughly 60 Furiosa tix so far while Tinseltown (Canton) has sold 40. I'm guessing the upfront audience does lean more toward the urban/cosmopolitan sensibilities (May 9). Presales show there's definitely some hype for this. Regal gonna irritate trackers again, offering no upcharge IMAX for Furiosa (May 8).)

- Charlie Jatinder ($3.05M Thursday comp.)

- el sid ($5.8M average Thursday comp (without Exorcist 2) (May 12). Furiosa continues its strong performance in ""my"" theaters. The movie yesterday had already 1.310 sold tickets (for Thursday, May 23). Up 15% in ca. 24 hours which isn't bad at all after the first rush.  Already comfortably in front of The Fall Guy's final sales (it had 1.071 counted on Thursday for Thursday) and almost on par with Civil War's final sales (1.357) and also the Apes finally had not more than 1.657 sold tickets in my theaters (May 11). I also can't complain about Furiosa's presales in my theaters, not at all. Already 1,138 sold tickets (in all of ""my"" 7 theaters) for May 23. 14 days left. Promising start. Civil War on Thursday of the release week for Thursday had 1,357 sold tickets and The Fall Guy finally had 1,071 sold tickets (May 9).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.51M Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (It has way stronger sales than Garfield and that is expected. I am thinking of 5m previews for now (May 14). I think this is a solid OD presales. With a short PS window its probably looking at 5m+ previews (May 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.44M Thursday comp. Keeps climbing at a strong pace (May 11). This continues to grow at an excellent rate (May 10). Really strong day 2. The short presales is for sure a factor (May 9). Not seeing much of a breakout. Still pretty solid start to presales (May 8).)

- vafrow ($2.9M Thursday comp. It had a good day (May 12). Mediocre day 2 (May 10). Not the hottest start. IMAX is the format of choice though, so, ATP will be high (May 9).)

**Hit Man**

- vafrow (Getting a theatrical release up here in Canada, and early signs are that it might get a pretty decent screen count. Not super wide or anything, but a pretty decent amount for a weekend that has a lot of other releases (May 14).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.24M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.76M EA comp and $1.19M Thursday comp.  Still not really accelerating, and the EA is falling against comps (May 12). Good EA numbers, but many of these comps were PLF-only EA, which this is not, so I think the ATP will be quite lower and that should be adjusted for (May 9).)

- AniNate (I definitely haven't seen as much of a rush here with Garfield as with IF (May 11).)

- el sid (The very even sales are a good sign (May 7). For Sunday, May 19, I can already report that also in my theaters it looks very good for Garfield. They will for sure add shows soon. It has so far only 1 show/theater and the shows are almost sold out, between 1 and 4 seats are still available. So my guess still is that this movie if it's not totally bad (and first reviews here were quite positive) will become a (big) hit. Seems not much on Thursday but it's a step in the right direction (May 6).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.52M EA+Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Its definitely weaker than even Elemental. That said these movies tend to finish strong and so I am not  writing it off so early. Just that the long PS window is irrelevant for them. They could rather start presales like a week before release and it would be all the same. | Meh. We have to wait until next week to gauge where its going to finish. It has very low ATP as well and actual would be even lower as its going to see tons of kids tickets (May 14). Early shows are regular digital shows at 1PM this sunday. So ATP will be very low. I think 500k ish at best. Preview let us see how things go in the final week. Presales at this point are almost non existent (May 13).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.14M Thursday comp.)

- vafrow ($0.4M Thursday comp. Comps don't paint a pretty picture though. EA shows are doing okay (May 11). Still no sales for my core sample for previews. But I did the larger sweep, which shows the interest right now is the Sunday early access shows. Looking at sales patterns, it's mainly blocks of 3/4 tickets, so likely families grabbing some. It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- BoxOfficePro (Fathom Events has also announced that select Regal Cinemas will present the films in 4DX on June 22/23/24 for Fellowship/Towers/Return respectively (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6).)

**Inside Out 2 Average Thursday Comp: $7.22M**

- AniNate (I do see a few 1-2 spots for Inside Out on Saturday. Think some M-F workweek adult fans might be putting down money for that (May 14).)

- katnisscinnaplex (Already at 180 shows for previews in my areas and still has a few theaters left to post.  For comparison, Godzilla x Kong finished with 197, Kingdom of Apes 190, and Kung Fu Panda 205 (May 14).)

- keysersoze123 (Too early to judge presales as ticket sales just started early this morning. Families dont book tickets on weekday mornings. Wait until evening today to judge it. From a release perspective its way bigger than all animation movies seen recently including Panda 4. Easily the biggest I have seen in a long time. Only movie which is not comparable is Mario but that was not just a family flick (May 14).)

- Porthos (On the Saturday of release weekend (ie NOT EA) there is a special event screening for IO2: INSIDE OUT 2: FUNKO FAMILY EVENT! (2024) Sat June 15th. Might boost the OW slightly, depending on how wide this event is and how much more these tickets will presumably cost (May 11).)

- TheFlatLannister ($7.22M Thursday comp. Well, I can't really tell if this is a breakout or not yet. Looks very good especially in the first few hours. These are probably terrible comps, but might as well try something (May 14).)

- TwoMisfits (I'm kinda shocked at the opening set from my Cinemarks... 2 screens (1 PLF, 1 not) and 6 showings at my PLF 14 for Thursday (and 11 showings on the same screens once it runs full day - 7 PLF b/c 1 is 3d on the reg screen, 4 not)... 3 screens (.75 3d, 2.25 not) and 9 showings at the non-PLF 12 for Thursday (and 12 showings on 2.25 screens once it runs full day)... So, 2 and 2.25 screens for the weekend presale sets... Disney must be charging a huge % for themselves b/c this is an Elemental opening set at my PLF...a little more generous for Thursday at my non-PLF, but then they too drop to an Elemental opening set after the adult Disney base Thursday rush... (May 14).)

- YM! (n fairness it's only been an hour but yeah sales are softer than I expected. However, it is a month out and will largely skew more towards kids than say TLM/Across so wasn't expecting a blitz like them. | Here at Marcus theaters are going all out for IO2 with it having the lion share of PLFs with it getting both screens when there is two PLFs with tentpole like levels of screens (May 14). Was taking a look at Marcus Cinemas to see that they have preloaded Inside Out 2 showtimes which seem to start at 3:00 pm on a Thursday. It seems like Marcus is going all out on it as judging from showtimes it's taking away all of Bad Boys‚Äô PLFs in that theaters that have two+ PLFs are giving all to IO2 (May 11).)

Fall Guy: A not so pretty 64% from last Tuesday drop as the movie won't hit 2 million dollars

KP4: A excellent 34% from last Tuesday drop as the movie is set to cross to 12 million dollars

Exhuma: A  sweet 13% drop as the movie is now a good bit across 11.9 million admits.

Challenger: An amazing increase by 11% from last Tuesday. 500k dollars should be locked. 


Notes for tomorrow.

Haikyuu has a CGV start of 69k. In expecting an opening day of close to 350k admits. It is going to be extremely frontloaded but it should double its presales in walk-ups

Garfield has a 27k start. Garfield should be sliding into a 250k admits opening day. 

I might be horrible and be wrong massively since I don't usually do opening day prediction myself. Plus we haven't had a whole lot of massive anime movies that opened since I started these post l. I think only The Boy and The Heron but that was massively affected by audience reactions being on the negative side.

I've been going to the cinema since I was a little kid to see cartoon movies with my parents and I already enjoyed too much seeing something at the cinema, when I grew up, apart from seeing tons and tons of films at my house I started to go to the cinema to watch more adult films. I remember ""In the heart of the sea"" when I didnt even know who Cillian Murphy was and I just knew Chris Hemsworth because Thor.

I lived through all the Marvel Dynasty, Disney remakes and sometimes original hits, through the new stars wars saga hit, through tons and tons of films of different topics and not just big IP films being completely hits at the box office.

But then, streaming and pandemic came in. As a completely cinema purist it felt like the industry that I loved since I was a kid was being attacked, that everything I loved was going down with no stops.

After pandemic I started to go to the cinema more than ever, but felt like something changed. 90% of my friends didnt care about the cinema no more, people didnt care about it no more. Every film was a failure, streaming was putting out films just a couple weeks after it was released on cinema, it was a disaster.

One time, for the first time in my life I went to the cinema alone to watch avatar 2 for 2nd time in IMAX after seeing it with a girl. And it felt so good, I was so comfortable that I started to do that on a regular basis. Last year I went to the cinema probably 20-30 times. I think 25 alone and enjoyed more than nothing.

Also watched around 300-350 films last year.

And after seeing the Fall Guy this year I felt like one of hobbies that I like the most its in his worst moment in history, it seems like no one is positive, like studios are giving up, originality is no more rewarded in this industry, people in Asia dont even care no more about Hollywood films (even tho they release preeetty good films almost every year for a while) getting a hit now was considered like a ""meh"" 5 years ago. And films like Monkey Man, Dune, Apes etc are amazing films that would reach a looot more audience years ago, and now if you're not an established IP, seems like people don't even care about what you bring to the table.",30,65

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

**520 Day(May 20th):**

The 20th of May is seen by many as an unofficial Valentines Day. Which means a lot of romance/drama coming out to make use of the date. Given its linked to a weekend this year many are using the chance to release as early as Friday to then link it to the Monday.
