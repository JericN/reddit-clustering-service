Most people say that it was Aladdin in 1992 when they casted Robin Williams as the Genie and for most of them, that is the correct answer which would made Aladdin get credited as the movie that kickstarted the celebrity voice acting trend in animated movies that we are seeing since after the movie came out. However, there's a movie that came out  six years before Aladdin that had an A-list celebrity voice cast, but for some reason, it wasn't credited for kickstarting the celebrity voice acting trend in animated movies. 

The movie that I am talking about is the original Transformers the movie that came out in 1986. The 1986 Transformers movie had a huge stack of voice talent that reprised their roles from the tv show such as Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and Frank Welker as Megatron.  Bur what made people really fell in love with the 86 Transformers movie was its usage of A-list celebrity voice acting for the new characters. The celebrity voice casting for the 86 Transformers movie consists of Judd Nelson from *The* *Breakfast Club* as Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime, Robert Stack from *The Untouchables* as Ultra Magnus, Leonard Nimoy of *Star Trek* fame as Galvatron, Eric Idle of *Monthy Python* fame, and the legendary Orson Welles as Unicron. A very stack cast of celebrity voice actors for this movie so this should be credited as the movie that started the celebrity voice acting trend, but Aladdin took the credit six years after the 1986 Transformers movie premired. So I want to find out should Aladdin not take the credit of being the movie that started the celebrity voice acting trend in animated movies when the 1986 Transformers movie had a huge stack of A-list celebrity voice actors six years prior to that?

Scenes used for exposition or character development during a time of crisis.  Sure, you can't always be on the run 24/7, there needs to be rest or downtime.  But with some sloppy writing or directing, these scenes can frustrate the viewer because there's no way they actually have time for this - confessing feelings, remembering something barely relevant, or a cheap gag.

I just thought about this recently finally bingeing Stranger Things.  And in Season 3, you know the example, when we finally get to meet Suzie.  She makes Dustin sing ""Never Ending Story"" while the Mind Flayer is in pursuit.  As impractical as this was, it was done well.  It was funny and a necessary break in an otherwise depressing/anxiety-inducing story.  So maybe not a good example of what I'm asking for, but I think you get the idea.

I was particularly impressed by Joan Chen's performance as the tragic Wanrong. 

Wanrong's life was just as terrible as it was in the movie, though the film didn't explore her mental health issues, you just see Wanrong turn self-destructive out of disappointment at seeing Pu Yi sell out to the Japanese. 

Still, Joan Chen gives a fearless performance, starting out as shy and sweet anf gradually becoming soturn and bored and miserable. The scene where she eats the flowers while Pu Yi is at the height of his recognition delivers a blow to the proceedings. She's the sole wife left and she has to endure the destruction of her family unit and then falling into Opium addiction and an implied Lesbian affair with a Female officer. By the end, Wanrong is a sickly zombie who's already dead inside as she wavers through the abandoned mansion before being taken away for her demise (in real life, Wanrong's death was ghastly, she lived for a year more, subjected to beatings, starvation and public humiliation until she died alone in a cell).",1,17

Kill Bill uses the Super 35mm format, crucial for its distinctive visual style. The Super 35mm captures a wider area of the image, which can be masked in post-production to achieve the desired aspect ratio, typically 2.35:1. This technique is closely related to the open matte, which adapts films to various projection formats while maintaining the visual content. During filming, cinematographer Robert Richardson and Tarantino used this format for greater flexibility in scene composition, capturing images with a broader aspect ratio, usually 1.37:1. In post-production, the image is masked to achieve the widescreen format, allowing more details to be shown above and below the image in TV versions compared to theatrical releases. The open matte offers significant advantages: it allows the film to be adapted to different screen formats without losing important details and preserves the original visual content. It also enhances the viewing experience on home screens. However, it can reveal elements not meant to be seen, like equipment, and may alter the director's stylistic intentions.

Let me explain.

In the prologue, we learn that the prince laughed at the old woman‚Äôs appearance. He turns her away because she is ugly. I‚Äôm pretty sure most people can tell the difference between someone turning them away due to being frightened and turning them away because they are prideful and make a mockery of an old person‚Äôs appearance. It‚Äôs crazy that so many people don‚Äôt think the Enchantress can tell the difference between basic social cues. This isn‚Äôt to say that the Enchantress was justified. That‚Äôs another argument. This is simply to state that the Beast was also not morally justified. 

I will say that people often long for the rich to be taught a lesson and should learn that those poorer than them are equal in value. But the Enchantress is ‚Äúevil‚Äù for teaching this lesson? We learn that the servants helped raise the prince and fed him his prideful ideologies. The only thing I think the Enchantress did that could be ‚Äúevil‚Äù was cursing the children too. However, it almost seems worse to not curse them and have them age while their parents stay the same. And of course cursing anyone would be evil if there is a possibility that they become permanently inanimate, but I always thought the Enchantress could see the future and knew the Beast would fall in love.

In summary, the second paragraph is basically a fact that many people don‚Äôt seem to realize but the third one is open to some interesting moral discussions.",8,0

What are some movies that don't seem like they should have anything in common, but they do? I'm not talking about the phenomenon of twin Hollywood movies that happens so often like Deep Impact vs Armageddon, Volcano vs Dante's Peak, and The Prestige vs the Illusionist. I'm talking about movies that have no business being talked about in the same sentence, but upon closer inspection, are weirdly connected to each other.

I'll start:

[King Ralph](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102216/?ref_=ext_shr)¬†(1991) is a screwball comedy targeted at bachelor dudes while¬†[The Princess Diaries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247638/?ref_=ext_shr)¬†(2001) is a rom com targeted at teenage girls, so the fact that they have such a similar premise is unexpected and delightful to me. 

The premise of both movies is: Last surviving member of a royal family in a European country happens to be some nobody from America who has to be coached into the role of monarch by a stuffy royal advisor - just with Anne Hathaway in the John Goodman role

I had high expectations since I heard it had really good reviews.

What a disappointment! For us, the pacing was all over the place, switching from scene to scene without much care for setup. The acting felt forced and too theatrical, like they were in an anime, which felt out of place in this realistic setting. The main character felt uninteresting and exhausting to watch with his self-hate and guilt. His relationships with his friends felt shallow because the movie jumped from scene to scene without proper setup. As a result, I didn't care about any of the human characters.

I liked all the Godzilla parts, but they were too far apart. This wouldn't have been a problem if I felt any connection to the human characters, but I didn't.

I get that there's a cultural difference in acting styles between Asian and Western countries. I know they like their drama and overacting, but it just didn't work for me in this realistic setting.

The OST was probably the best part about it for me.

If you liked this movie, that's fine. I am not looking to read walls of text explaining what I might not have understood about the movie or how I'm not capable of understanding its depth. Everyone has different tastes, and this one just didn‚Äôt resonate with me. What did you think?",76,0

A recent one for me, it's Adventureland. I was in college when it came out and I actually didn't like it at the time because I thought it was going to be like Superbad but it had much more drama than the advertising let on. But I would watch it on streaming every few years when it would pop up and each time I'd like it a little bit more. I re-watched it a few weeks ago and for some reason this time it just hit me perfectly, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since then.

I think at the time I didn't feel it as much because I was the same age as the characters and it was just my life in a different decade. I was working a shitty job I hated (local fast food joint) and the only thing that made it tolerable were my co-workers, I was in an ""it's complicated"" relationship with my girlfriend, and I was getting ready for the next stage of life. Watching it again 15 years later, I can feel the wistfulness for that very small time frame in your life, both for my own experience and in the movie. I wouldn't call it nostalgia, I'm certainly not giving up my well-paying, grown-up job to go sling fries, just so I can have that ""we're all in this shitty job together"" kinship with a group of people, but it does make me remember the novelty of those feelings and experiences.

Allow me to explain. It has to it, that feeling where you can just smell the place.

Another example would be Nashville. There is just something about these movies which make me cry just thinking about it. The characters usually have these really tragic arcs and they find some sort of bittersweet feeling at the end of it and we root for those characters to succeed even though they are extremely flawed.

There is confusion when

Bruno says, ""Do you know who owns part of the laundry?""

Sheeran: ""No.""

Bruno: ""I do""

S: ""Who owns the laundry""

At this point Sheeran, not the brightest guy which is part of the character, shows a bit of confusion. He actually thinks Bruno is playing guessing games with him -- he does not realize that Bruno means, ""I own the laundry"" but instead ""I KNOW who owns the laundry"" and so Sheeran is asking Bruno to tell him. He then goes on to explain that he, Angelo Bruno, owns the laundry not that he merely knows and wants Sheeran to guess.

This is quite interesting -- I am not sure if Bruno is supposed to be slightly amused and same thing about Pesci's character -- just the slightest of smiles?

Or are they in fact showing no reaction except slight frustration on Bruno's part at Sheeran's obtuseness and they are discussing something far too serious to be amused at all?

Because this meeting was about Sheeran having screwed up royally and only Bufalino's intercession saved Sheeran from being thrown to the Jews who own that laundry he is part owner of. And Sheeran still has to murder the guy who misled him into destroying the laundry.

I suspect the genius director wanted to show that the despite the humorous potential of Sheeran's confusion, nobody was even slightly amused.

On the other hand, maybe Scorsese wanted to include this slightly humorous bit to show that these men had a sense of humor despite all being vicious killers. Note that not all of the gangsters showed much of this -- Joey Gallo made a frankly inane quip about playing dice on a carpet, but he really displayed no sense of humor if the jokes were remotely at his expense. (Did you know that supposedly he was going to kill Johnny Carson for disrespecting a woman who was either his girlfriend or just an acquaintance  of his (of Gallo)? Considering whom Gallo actually killed, this is quite plausible story.)",12,0

It's actually really good. For once, autism is portrayed authentically. The son easily gets on your nerves but you still want to see things go right for him.

Some jokes fall flat, sometimes it can be sentimental, some characters you could have cut out, but this film isn't concentrating on being a masterpiece.

It's rather difficult to make out the year and mint (especially from my video) but I've settled on the year being either 1901 or 1921, both of which I believe have significance in relation to the mystery detective fiction genre from which the film draws inspiration.

Firstly, 1901 was the release year for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Hound of the Baskervilles,"" which was a return to the series after a long hiatus. Doyle had grown tired of writing for the same characters, but after much demand it returned with what ultimately became one of Holmes' most popular stories. Not only do I feel that the context for how the story came to be is similar to the film itself as a return to form for the genre, but the story itself shares a major similarity. ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is a bit of a departure from the classic Holmes tales as it sees Watson filling the shoes of investigator for the majority of the time, offering a different dynamic and showing how Watson at times struggles to match Holmes in his skills. This dynamic is something that director Rian Johnson has indirectly shared a preference for in his own films, noting that he does not want Benoit Blanc to be the main character of each story, choosing instead to favor Marta and Helen in each of his films, respectively, with Blanc still fulfilling the role of brilliant detective in the end. I believe that Blanc's rhetorical query to Marta is even more pertinent now that I've made this connection: ""The game is afoot... Eh, Watson?""

Second is 1921. This marked the UK publication date for the very first detective novel by Agatha Christie, featuring Hercule Poirot in ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles."" This parallel works well as being the introduction for a famed detective, and the story shares some striking comparisons, too. They both take place in large, isolated manors with multiple suspects, featuring a deceased elderly individual with an ever-changing will, poison, and disguise. This novel was a massive influence on the genre as a whole, as many of the aspects of the story eventually became common tropes, as evidenced by Knives Out.

I would be satisfied with either of these dates because both connections feel so substantial. Was it intentional? Nothing that I've read so far has explained this, but I'd like to think so! Let me know what you guys think!",10,12

I only narrowed it down to Disney films. So no Pixar and whatnot.

Would love to see what other people‚Äôs lists are, and their opinions, etc etc.
Spoilers ahead for those who haven‚Äôt seen these.
Anyways, here‚Äôs mine! 

1: Lion King.
Generic choice, I know. Everyone and their mother likes this movie.
But like, it‚Äôs the frickin Lion King. Gorgeous animation. AMAZING soundtrack. Fantastic story and characters. I don‚Äôt even need to explain myself here.
It‚Äôs the Lion King.

2: Mary Poppins.
People don‚Äôt seem to talk about this film, in my experience anyway. 
It‚Äôs honestly one of the best films I‚Äôve ever watched, not just Disney, but in general. As an adaptation it doesn‚Äôt do very well, having read the book. The differences are quite vast.
But as a film? Oh my gosh! It‚Äôs teeming with whimsy, imagination, creativity. The story makes your heart soar and break. (The scene where Mr Banks walks to get fired with that music in the background is brilliantly haunting).
Man. I adore this. So so much.

3: Princess and the Frog.
I‚Äôd like to start off by saying I‚Äôve never really agreed with the: ‚ÄúMovie gets worse when she turns into a frog.‚Äù Sentiment. I‚Äôve thought about it, and can‚Äôt really see the film without that happening. It‚Äôs the cataclysm for Tiana‚Äôs character change. And can I just say that Tiana is one of the best written Disney characters, no, characters period I‚Äôve ever seen. Her and Naveen are a perfect couple, because their personalities contrast so well. Naveen needs to learn how to work a little harder, and Tiana needs to learn how to relax a little. 
This is shown so well when she teaches him how to mince, and he teaches her how to dance.
The reason I think the Frog thing works so well is because it‚Äôs the perfect environment for our characters change. Naveen is humbled by it, and Tiana is shown a new perspective on it. In an environment where she can‚Äôt drown herself in work, and surrounded by characters such as Ray, Louis and Mama Odie, she is given a new outlook on life, inciting the change that she eventually demonstrates in the fantastic scene where Dr Facilier offers her the deal. I also love how it doesn‚Äôt completely shoot down her working hard, just speaks to the idea that there‚Äôs more to life than just one thing. 
And the music, omg the music! When We‚Äôre Human is my favourite song. Listen to that whenever I‚Äôm feeling down. Friends on the Other side doesn‚Äôt even need my praise, everyone agrees on that one.
Dig a Little Deeper? That choir is like having an ethereal experience. 
Almost There! Truly inspiring!
Louis is my favourite character btw. The Gators a bro. 
Don‚Äôt get me started on Ray‚Ä¶ the tears man. The bloody tears.
Was gonna mention Lottie too, but I‚Äôll keep it brief. What can I say? She‚Äôs spoiled, but such a fantastic friend, and under all that pampering she‚Äôs a great person to the people around her. She even tells the guy she rejects that she‚Äôs sure loads of other women would love to dance with him, she just doesn‚Äôt have the same feelings.
Anyway. I‚Äôm done now. Moving on.

4: Lilo and Stitch.
Bro this film is amazing! For a film that had such a low budget, the animation is truly top tier.
(Btw I don‚Äôt tell a lie. Disney didn‚Äôt believe in this movie, so the creators barely had a budget to work with).
Lilo and Stitch have amazing chemistry. The characters are funny, entertaining! Jumba and Pleakley provide a comically well done side plot. Lilo and Nani have such a touching relationship. The Elvis music is a great addition.
I can‚Äôt say much that hasn‚Äôt already been said.
Top tier! 

5:
Zootopia/Tangled.
Ok, this is definitely cheating. But I‚Äôm sorry, could not put one or the other off the list.
To start with Tangled: This is one of, if not the most underrated Disney films ever. No one seems to talk about it.
Rapunzel is a fantastic character. I‚Äôve listened to: ‚ÄúWhen will My Life Begin.‚Äù So many times I practically know every word by heart.
Mother Gothel is a fantastic villain. Me and a friend watched it recently, and the amount of times we were able to point out her subtle abusive and manipulation tactics were insane. 
The songs are brilliant, and the setting is gorgeous. The scene where she first leaves the tower gives me chills every time.
And Eugene‚Äôs sacrifice at the end? Man. That scene hit hard.
Zootopia just ticks all the right boxes man. Maybe except the villain? I‚Äôve seen people say they don‚Äôt like the Twist villain, but she‚Äôs never really bothered me. I wouldn‚Äôt say she‚Äôs very memorable, but I don‚Äôt think the story needed her to be. The focus is on Judy and Nicks friendship.
And my gosh, so they have such great chemistry.
The mystery is so endearing. Judy as a character is engaging from the start. I remember seeing it in theatres, coming out surprised. I certainly hadn‚Äôt expected a buddy cop action flick but my gosh I wasn‚Äôt disappointed.
The world is interesting, and the commentary is very good as well. I love the song. And the plot is so cleverly thought out.
It‚Äôs up there man, it‚Äôs up there!

That‚Äôs all.
There were so many others I wanted to put, but these were the best I was able to narrow down for the top five. I contemplated so many times putting Alice in Wonderland, Mulan, Moana, Frozen, Aladdin in too. But while I love these movies, I don‚Äôt think I like them enough to put them over the films already in the list.
Anyways. That‚Äôs me. Opinion might change in the future, but who knows.
Glad to hear anyone else‚Äôs thoughts!
Thanks a lot, and have a great rest of your day! ",37,0

Finch is such a simple movie to describe without really spoiling anything. In a post apocalyptic America where the sun roasts everything, Finch (Tom Hanks) builds a robot to care for his dog as he is aging and begins a cross county journey to try and find a better life.

Thats it. And that is really all the movie is. Its Tom Hanks being great as he is in everything. The world is simple but interesting. The visual effects are believable, especially the Robot. And the voice over work for the robot is great. 

I really miss movies like this. I sat down, got exactly what was written on the tin, done well, and the movie ended and I went on with my life. But it captured my attention for its entire runtime.

I wish more people would give this movie a shot and I dont see it talked about often.

Night Shyamalan‚Äôs new thriller ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù,"Usually I‚Äôm not one to speculate on the plot of unreleased mysteries/thrillers like this one, but I‚Äôm very intrigued by the revelations in the trailer.

M. Night Shyamalan has had mixed criticisms in his more recent filmography, so I imagine he really wants to captivate his audience with his newest release.

In the trailer, a huge ‚Äútwist‚Äù is revealed that shows Josh Hartnett‚Äôs character being the killer whom the police are after. That begs the question, what does M. Night have up his sleeve. I have a few theories.

1. There are two killers in the building and Hartnett thinks he is the only ‚ÄúButcher‚Äù, but really the police are after someone else.

2. Hartnett is a paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from delusional thoughts. He may be making up the entire situation, think he is the killer but isn‚Äôt, or he is the killer but the police are not actually. This is possible because the attendant who Hartnett talks to in the trailer seemed to be acting very over the top. Although that could be just the intended M. Night style.

3. His daughter is a Vampire and he is using these people as cattle to keep her fed. This would be very far fetched but is something I could see Shyamalan doing.

What do you think of these theories and do you all have any fun ones?

Edit: it‚Äôs also worth noting the daughter says ‚ÄúThis is going to be the best night ever‚Äù which would make sense if she was a vampire because he would only bring her out at night. Just a thought.",22,0

And seeing now... I don't get it lmao. I mean, I get it in some ways. I understand highschool films are popular in a lot of circles and that it hits just the exact same amount of points of those kind of films along with including the heavy subject of child molestation. But that's my big issue with it. It's soooooo derivative. Like super derivative. It's very easy to tell what's gonna happen at nearly every moment in the movie and it doesn't do anything at all unique with the genre. It touches on so many old story beats and tropes that I just couldn't help but be deeply unimpressed by it.

I also think the inclusion of child molestation felt pretty emotionally manipulative and kinda insulting imo. It really just felt like it relied on that aspect in order to try to make the movie feel more ""meaningful"" by touching in such an inherently heavy subject but even then, it just felt... kinda disconnected from the rest of the film and I think the symptoms/characterization expressed by the protagonist to this trauma was underwhelming. It didn't feel at all like it had any particular important relevance with the rest of the picture other than just another burden on his shoulders in order to make us feel more of that cheap sympathy for him.

I also think it implies that the reason he kisses his crush over his girlfriend in that truth or dare is because of his past being molested as a kid and I'm like: ""That doesn't make much sense"". Like yes, sexual trauma can lead to sexual impulsiveness but that's not what's happening. He's kissing the girl because she's the one he likes and not her but it kinda makes it about this subconscious thing that led him to make this decision due to how he was hurted in the past. It just makes him unnecessarily look like an asshole and poorly presents how people do behave after going through such a horrible event.

To prove even more that the movie is just including the subject of abuse to try to portray itself as more profound than it actually is, there's a moment in the beginning where it shows like his sister being hit by her boyfriend. We are meant to be feeling bad for her that she's trying to stay with him even though he's hurting her. Like this is a moment that should feel like it should come up later and to be confronted in some way but the movie just brings that up and never touches upon it again. It was just to show how this thing is bad and that it happens but it won't longer be relevant to the narrative. I guess you can say it connects to the main protagonist having been abused and not speaking about it but the issue is that the film gives this moment this emotional weight that it never pays off later. It's just lazy and there's very little to nothing to this moment.

Oh and the Flash person plays one of the main characters who is meant to be the likable stereotypical gay dude so that's also a ""positive"" right there lmao. The plot aspect with his self-hating boyfriend is also something I have seen way too many times before.

Admittedly, it wasn't boring. I did think it was paced well and I do think the main performances are pretty decent but I just didn't get anything of value from its story and I felt I've seen this so many times before and with content which has been executed a lot better in other movies. Want a great school movie representing what it means to have anxiety and be a social outcast? Watch ""Eight Grade"". Want a powerful coming-of-age narrative touching on the dark nuances about trauma and abuse of children? ""Mysterious Skins"" is your film. Want a good teenage romance where the main character opens up more about themselves to people while touching on a very serious and emotional subject matter? Watch ""I Want To Eat Your Pancreas"" and that unlike that one, the heavy subject felt earned and like it really wanted to make sure to give it the respect and attention to detail that it needs.

But yeah, super predictable and unoriginal teenage story with a 4th grader's emotional understanding of abuse and child abuse. Genuinely disappointed by this movie knowing the huge popularity it was getting.",43,0

Now obviously some of this is subjective so if you happen to think Red Heat is the best Arnold movie. Go ahead an list it. 

Im currently trying to find my picks for this but there is always a dip. Like Tom Hanks is a good one but You've got mail is only ok and Saving Private Ryan is directly before it.

There's a lot for me, one example is Wesley Snipes' narration at the beginning of Blade II. This sequel surpassed its original in almost every way, Guillermo del Toro's direction is spot on. From the music he selected, to the stylized action sequences, to how much SCARIER it is!

My starter list:
Do the Right Thing  
Raising Victor Vargas  
City of God  
Falling Down  
Predator  
Fury Road  

Do the Right Thing came to my mind first. It really captured the feeling of a hot summer day in NYC starting with the sweaty morning wake up through all the street scenes in Bed-Stuy.

Raising Victor Vargas is a little obscure but one of my my favorites. It also showcased a NYC summer viscerally as the characters came of age in cramped apartments, sizzling streets and public pools.

I initially thought of a list of summer heat in NYC movies but I expanded elsewhere because City of God immediately came to my mind. The cinematography doubles the heat and tension as you follow Rocket and the others in the favelas.

What are your favorites?

The first DH is obviously a classic and one of the best action movies ever made. The second DH has a weaker villain and weaker writing, but it at least has some fun action scenes. Also, it ends with the bad guys' plane exploding, so that's pretty cool. The third DH is definitely the best sequel in my opinion. Bruce and Sam Jackson have great chemistry together, Jeremy Irons is a memorable villain, and the action set pieces are intense and pulse-pounding. Also, you really get a sense of how big New York is in this film as both protagonists have to really rush to get to different locations in time. The climax isn't as exciting as it could've been, but overall, *Die Hard with a Vengeance* is still a fun movie and by far the best sequel in the DH franchise. I recently rewatched DH 4 and 5 to see if they were as bad as I remember them being, but to my surprise, they weren't awful flicks. Like DH 2, *Live Free or Die Hard* doesn't have amazing villains, but it does have some memorable action scenes. John's daughter is kind of grating at times, but she doesn't ruin the movie or anything. And finally, DH 5. I think the reason a lot of people hate *A Good Day to Die Hard* is because it's very generic and *Die Hard* is not supposed to be generic. But for as generic as it is, it's not that bad of a movie. Once again, there are fun action scenes and the villains here are at least written better than most other DH villains. Also, John's son is a better character than his daughter, but that's not saying much. So yeah, not a single awful movie in the bunch. Could some of them been better? Definitely. But when most movie franchises have some entries that are just downright GARBAGE, it's refreshing that at least one beloved franchise never got to that level of shit. That being said, I REALLY hope they don't make another DH movie. No one wants *Die Hard* to do a ""Dial of Destiny"" like poor Dr. Jones.",34,0

*San Andreas* has that perfect mix of gang conflicts, heists, and larger-than-life characters. Do you know any movies that have a similar feel ?

I for one love that kind of film, something that evokes more of a feeling and takes its time to immerse/operate in the way the filmmaker wants it to. I‚Äôve enjoyed the more disturbing/complex/emotional films I‚Äôve seen, they make me feel things that sometimes I usually wouldn‚Äôt catch or notice. Dont get me wrong, there‚Äôs some bad movies out there that are also like this. But I feel like we need more movies that aren‚Äôt spoon feeding the audience, cookie cutter plots, or sequels/reboots. 

Those for sure have their place! I love a movie I can turn my brain off on, but I feel like I really crave something that has more substance and nuance.

Bit of a standard trope of the not to be fucked with former assassin (who left the life for his wife) protecting a child.

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where the story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",288,739

In Hot Rod, Rod needs to raise $50k so his step-dad (who he hates) can afford a conveniently priced surgery, and then Rod can kick his step dad‚Äôs ass and it will actually mean something and he‚Äôll earn his respect  

I just watched Hook for the first time in forever, and was tickled at how these storylines mirror each other

In fact, sometimes it's hard to say where mainstream European movies end and porn starts. For years, I thought some [Italian sex comedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_sexy_all'italiana) movies I watched were just very high quality porn.

But it lead me to noticing another, probably more significant difference. Americans are obsessed with sexual exclusivity. It's a common trope for American romantic comedies to have a main character (almost always a male, though I think there are a few rare female examples) who sleeps around a lot, but eventually finds their true love and decides that he doesn't want to have sex with anyone else. I don't think I've ever seen an American movie where the main couple decides to have an ""open relationship"" or something. Sometimes you might have a main character's friend keep their promiscuous lifestyle, but I feel like it's used to highlight how much better/more mature the main characters are.

In European movies, however, it's not uncommon for the happy ending to be about the main couple learning that they can have a good relationship while enjoying having sex with other people.

So, your thoughts? Did I completely miss some American movies which end with happy polygamous relationships?",82,0

Rewatching it, it's impressive to see how many names are there, even for one scene. Selma Blair gets ineffectively hit on by the main jock (aside; major props for Peter Facinelli in making Mike Dexter the ultimate high school asshole). Sarah Rue calls everyone ""sheep."" Jason Segal (!) is doing something with that watermelon. And so on, as there's always something going on in the background of this and some minor character to provide a laugh. (My personal favorite; Chris ""Shermanator"" Owens as ""Klepto Kid"" stealing everything he sees.) For a film that didn't do much business when it came out, it's great to see how well it holds up as a ensemble showcase and a time capsule of its era (nothing like having a pay phone being a key plot point to date a film). 

Added note; I love how aside from the six main characters (Embry, Hewitt, Facinelli, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose and Seth Green), nearly all of the characters are given no names. Even in the credits, they're referred to as ""Klepto Kid"", ""Girl Whose Party It Is"", ""Yearbook Girl"" and so on.

I think F1-F4 are all entertaining movies but are mid. The first 2 feel very dated now although the OG has its pros. But Fast Five changed things up big time and brought life back into the franchise. The next 2 maintain the same quality I feel and Furious 7 has the perfect ending this series could have asked for. F8-F10 become the Dominic Toretto show and physics, logic and reason have no place in them at all. It has become a meme worthy series now and the dwindling box office results of the last 2 are signs that fans are losing interest.

Anyways, coming to the F5-F7 trilogy, F5 is the blueprint to what the franchise has now become. But it feels very fresh and organic here. There is an 'edge' to it. Dominic still has the anti-hero swagger which got lost F7 onwards. The Rock as Hobbs was a menacing presence. The favelas of Brazil added a lot of atmosphere and the plot involving 3 parties colliding with each others' interest was engrossing.

Fast and Furious 6 is arguably just as good as Fast Five. 2/3 of the movie is set in London and that might arguably be the best portion of the series. This is the first time a character returns from the death. But they have a cheat here since we never actually saw Letty die in F4. Luke Evans' Owen Shaw is a very charismatic presence. Nice to see Hobbs join the team. The initial chase through the streets of London is very fun. And it's exciting to see Hobbs' team take on Shaw's similar team. Each character again gets their fair share of screentime. The Dom vs Letty race is fantastic. Lot of tension there. When things move to Spain is when physics gets abused badly although the tank scene and the airport runaway scene are really fun. I love how in these movies almost all members of the team get to do physical stuff. Unlike say Mission Impossible or Bond where it's Ethan or Bond in action as the rest sit out behind the screens. Credit where it is due, each sequence in the F&F franchise has so many moving parts in them. Fast and Furious 6 ends on a good note where the team get pardons and return to LA.

Furious 7 has less of a reason to exist and is a bit of a downgrade in quality but I have to credit James Wan here for good direction. It being Paul walker's last movie also holds value. The Caucasus mountains action scene is arguably the best setpiece of the series. Kurt Russel was a nice addition and Statham is intimidating as well. But I do feel Abu Dhabi and LA sequences get too gimmicky. I also dislike how Vin diesel starts dominating proceedings in this one. Previously things were nicely balanced with Walker's Brian.  But the ending they give to Walker is worth the movie.

So if any new viewers are interested, F5-F7 is must watch in the action genre. The earlier ones can be ignored. And F8-F10 are devoid of any logic or reasonable story. The whole formula gets stale at this point. Even the action spectacles lose creativity at this point. When cars start taking on submarines is when you know filmmakers dont respect the audience anymore.

But it shouldn't take away that Fast Five and Furious 6 are great action pics.

Why does Hollywood feel the need to remake or revamp beloved and iconic movies that do not need it. Jurassic park/Jurassic world, Independence Day/its sequel, the Disney remakes(Lion king, little mermaid, etc) Those of us in the ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù generation got these movies fresh, without anything to compare them to when they first came out in the 90s. (The closest movie to twister before we saw it in theatres was the wizard of oz) We grew up with these movies and they grew up with us, they are personal to us. Now, new and badly written versions of the same films are being made to please the new generations instead of Hollywood coming up with fresh ideas. 

Anyway, so after watching the trailer for Twisters, I am willing to bet this is just another one of those films that takes all the funny, iconic and unique stuff from the first film and puts it in a special effect filled garbage pile instead of it being its own unique film. I bet it slips in the famous Twister quotes we all know like   ‚ÄúDEBRIS!‚Äù and ‚ÄúCOWS‚Äù, it‚Äôll have its own Dusty and its own take at the drive-in scene. How many of us wanted a red Dodge Ram after watching twister? Will kids these days feel the same as we did almost 30 years ago? (I had to check my math because 1996 feels more like 20 years ago to me and I‚Äôm 35 lol)

 I feel like if you absolutely had to make a updated Twister revamp, it should have been a prequel to Twister following Jo and Bill before the 1996 film. Twister starts with a backstory that we don‚Äôt know any detail of besides the fact that Jo‚Äôs dad was killed in an F5, Bill and Jo are getting divorced and Bill doesn‚Äôt want to chase anymore. It would‚Äôve been neat to see what led to that. 

One day they‚Äôll  start remaking absolute classics like Jaws, and we will know for sure Hollywood has lost its imagination. ",55,0

I understand: 

1. she is there as FBI agent to collaborate with other federal agencies therefore  to legitimizing the operations.

2. She is looking to make more of an impact than her regular work in Phoenix

3. If she wasn't at the border scene, one of the characters would have been dead from the corrupt police flanking the rear.

Things I don't understand

1. Did her advisors not tell her that she would be working with black op teams. Why is it an incentive to keep her in the dark? 

2. Most of the investigating and plot progression is done by Alejandro and Matt. I feel the progression would have gone the same if she never even showed up. It seems like they meant it for Kate to stay in her apartment but enjoyed having her along for resources. 

3. If Alejandro's plan is to get revenge on a huge cartel boss and kill him. Why would Kate have a problem with the methods if the result is what everyone wants. I'm guessing she feels uncomfortable that her status as FBI was being used to legitimize the operation rather than her actual skills as an agent.

1) Scream. First off, Drew Berrymore's performance was simply fantastic. Not many horror movies get well-renowned actors like her to give such A-tier performances for less than 20 minutes of screentime. On top of that, the visual storytelling was great. The symbolism of the stovetop popcorn as the tension rises. The voice acting from Roger L Jackson as ghost face. The visual effects. Simply phenomenal. The intro of this movie alone could stand by itself as a short film.   


2) The Interview. First off, getting Eminem to agree to coming out as gay was hilarious. There's also some really good one-liners in it that my friends and I say to this day. ""Hector's rectum is real,"" was so damn funny. I love that they posted that phrase in big yellow letters as if it were breaking news.   


3) Inception's intro was really good too. I loved that they crammed so much exposition about the world-building in 10 minutes. Not to mention the amazing practical effects from the water, the Japanese-looking set design, and the hans zimmer soundtrack.

So then why did he act surprised? Obviously it's for the audience's benefit, to keep us thinking that Slevin is indeed a random unlucky guy. But once the reveal is made, that element seems to fall flat, and not work within the fullness of the story.

 What if Argyle and Theo are related and say Theo already knows Hans will kill him after the job instead of paying him, so decides at the last minute to rip Hans off for all the loot?  Maybe Theo and Argyle spoke in the parking garage and Theo mentioned how he had close to a billion dollars on him.   I don't care who the employee is; no hourly employee is ever going to turn down hundreds of millions of dollars for the warm feeling of ""doing the right thing."" 

Also, Argyle might be the nicest guy in the universe, but he literally has just met John, and he is doing him a very large solid.  You could say it's because he wants a fat tip, but John wouldn't be in charge of that; the corporation that hired Lemo would handle that.

They may not even be great lines of dialogue, but maybe it was the way the character said it. Maybe it was a really powerful quote that's stuck with you throughout the years and has had a profound effect on your life.

For me, there are a handful of quotes that have really resonated with me throughout my life. Some from good-to-great movies and some from bad ones. One particularly bad movie, *The Change-Up,* starring Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds, essentially a *Freaky Friday* but men instead of women. In the movie, Reynolds character is a fuck up and someone who goes through life trying new things and never quite finishing them. In the pivot scene where his character finally sucks it up, he says out loud to himself (after he switches bodies with Bateman), ""I'm not a FUCKING quitter!"" As someone who really related with that character it helped me better my life. At the time, it felt like he was saying it to me even. Thankfully, I've been in a much better situation in life because I've been able to power through hardships more easily these days. What's wild is I saw that movie about 10 years ago and still think about it when I feel like giving up. I can't even find the actual quote or scene online either

Another one is from *The Wrestler,* where Mickey Rourke's character gives his final speech and talks about his regrets in life and how he is much older and broken, before delivering, ""but god dammit, I'm still standing here!"" That delivery alone gave me chills the first time I watched it and made me reflect on my own life and regrets and how through all these years of adversity, I'm still standing, even if barely.

However, I have never heard any examples of this trend. The idea is that the first installment sets up the characters, world, conflict, etc.; the finale delivers the closure and resolution of the story; and the middle of the story is where the pressure is burdened to carry the story in a meaningful way that still stands alone as a film with it's own beg/mid/end. The theory behind MMS is that it is because of this pressure on 2nd films that they tend to be more disappointing than the other installments. At least, that is my understanding, and yet I don't recall ever hearing a single legit example that supports this theory, let alone a trend of examples. 

I can think of several trilogies that debunk this theory, where the middle film stands out as the better of the 3. Spider-Man 2, Empire Strikes Back, The Two Towers all have RT scores higher than their respective bookends. Other films like The Godfather Part II, Aliens, Terminator 2 are great sequels, so I don't know where the middle movie syndrome came from. 

In fact, I think it's more often the 3rd and final film in a franchise that tends to disappoint. Not trying to start any fights, but Rise of Skywalker, Spider-Man 3, The Godfather Part III all are generally agreed to be worse than their predecessors. Again, not trying to debate, just trying to establish the point of this incomprehensible theory that's been running in my mind recently, which I can't even recall how it came to me. 

So is MMS a thing or just something my Mandela affected mind has misconceived? Can anyone give examples of middle films that fit the description? Or at least can you validate me by confirming that MMS is something that you've also heard of? (Maybe not in so many words, but at least the concept.) Any help is appreciated for my peace of mind.

Canadians get bombarded with American media (this is not a commentary on that), and somewhere along the way, we get lost in our own individuality or sovereignty. There's a professor named David Pike who has broken down Canadian film into four categories, or themes that seem to be prevalent in Canadian cinema:

1. Films that take a dialectical approach to its technology and its effect especially on the body
2. Films of alienation
3. Films exploring sexual identity
4. Films about cultural difference, ethnic identity, and marginality

While I agree that these themes tended to be the case, years ago, when the professor wrote, there has been, thankfully, much more indigenous representation to our country's storytelling. There is no singularity in a Canadian story and I love that about my country. That being said, Canada has some great cinema, and I wonder how many are aware? Have you seen a Canadian movie? What is your favourite Canadian movie? There are MANY movies with Canadian connections; whether by a Canadian director (James Cameron, Denis Villeneuve...) or a Canadian actor (Jim Carrey, Mike Myers....), but are you aware of any movies that are uniquely Canadian?

The Canadian Screen Awards presentation is being broadcast today on the CBC and you can watch it free, if you  seek it...

There's also less *colorful* side-characters and focus on them in ""Boy Kills World"" since most of the focus is in our MC.

""Boy Kills World"" is also eventually significantly more violent than ""Bullet Train"". In one fight scene, our MC used a grater box as a weapon. I consider myself desensitized to most violence in movies, but damn that scene had me cringing afff. Also, the final fight scene is very serious and deliciously brutal.

The story is about a unicycle that lives in a bicycle shop. It‚Äôs kinda hanging out in the corner at closing time and is sleeping. Now, as the unicycle sleeps, he has a dream where he‚Äôs performing in a circus with a clown(who doesn‚Äôt look very appealing but this was the late 80s) riding on him and juggling balls. Eventually, the unicycle becomes independent of the clown and starts to juggle balls himself. Sounds pretty cute so far.

So, after the crowd erupts into applause and the unicycle is bowing, he wakes up and realizes that it was all a dream. Depressed, he returns to his corner. And I shit you not, that‚Äôs where the short ends.

like...what the actual fuck? that is such a sad ending, especially for a short that had been pretty cute up to that point. imagine if luxo jr had just ended with the ball deflating.

Monday: Slasher - stuff like nightmare on elm street, friday the 13th, haloween etc.

Tuesday: Space Horror - Event horizon, Alien...

Wednesday: Haunted House - The Haunting, Poltergeist, Rose red...

Thursday: Zombie - I'm stumped, there are so many I really don't know what to choose

Friday: Otherworldly monster - the thing, necronomicon, the fog...

Saturday: ""Real life"" - open water, Frozen (not the cartoon, the 2010 with Shawn Ashmore :P)

Sunday: Found Footage - blair witch, cloverfield... I know many people hate these but I can't help it but have some sort of weird fascination with these

  
Now I don't really have a time limit so I can pack as many movies in a day as I want but I'd like it to be reasonable - anything over 12-15 hours would be insane... right? So even though I actually like Bastion (or Rose Red  for that matter) I'm not sure about including them due to their runtime.

It was so good that I saw it again today. For some reason I just never sat and watched it from beginning to end. I saw it on TV sometimes when I was a kid and remember thinking ""Hey it's Ernie Hudson from Ghostbusters!"" but I also remember hearing about what happened on set and like other movies I heard about it sort of made me not watch. 

This movie is might be one of my favorite movies now. It's so good that I'm glad I didn't watch it fully before seeing The Dark Knight because I saw that 4 times in 2008. I knew that The Dark Knight was influenced a lot by Heat which I had seen already in the 90s and loved it and still do. I know Christopher Nolan talked about it. I also knew Heath Ledger's Joker was inspired by characters like Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange and probably heard something about The Crow, but The Dark Knight took a lot more from The Crow than I realized.

Ernie Hudson is basically Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon. Like when The Crow disappears during a conversation ""He does that sometimes."" There is so much more throughout. Including scenes that use the same camera angles and everything with the table and the villains. Similar quotes about chaos, disorder and anarchy. It seemed like so much more than just the hair-style and makeup.

I still like The Dark Knight but I don't think I would have seen it as many times if I had seen The Crow first. Also that soundtrack! I'm not a big grunge rock guy but if I watched this entire movie when I was a kid instead of just parts on TV I think I would have been really into it. I always liked NIN so hearing their song during a scene was awesome. The model sets I liked a lot! 

What surprised me the most though was how emotional it was. Seeing it a second time today I almost cried. Brandon Lee was incredible! I really liked scenes like when Eric visits Sgt. Albrecht. It had a nice score in the background and it was just parts like that I didn't expect. Or the relationship with the mother and daughter. I like when Eric gives the girl the necklace.

(Teens in the 2000s were eating good) I'm wondering what happened to cause this shift?",43,0

If studios don't take a stand against AI and instead work to adopt and evolve this technology, aren't we just going to get to a point when anyone can just prompt their own movies? This may be 20 years in the future, but if this tech is adopted it will come to pass. 

So if in 20 years there's tech that allows me to prompt my own completely perfect personal movies, why would I ever pay for someone else's movie using the same AI tech? Seems like these studios are going to adopt this and bring about their own undoing. Movies are going to become our own personal algorithmic creations, just like our social feeds now. And before you say that sounds like craziness, just look at Sora AI video generator and compare that to where we were only a few years ago. It's like a quantum leap. Now flash forward 20 years. 

TLDR: Are studios bringing about their own end by funding the adoption and evolution of this generative AI tech that will one day allow consumers to create their own films, rendering the value proposition of their own products worthless?",24,0

Since this is the 40th anniversry of the Transformers franchise, I am going to do something special to celebrate it. For many people, the Transformers movie that was made from 1986 is what people thought about when talking about the 80s. The original Transformers movie is without a doubt the most 80s movie that I have ever seen. Everything about this movie really defined what the 80s was back then. From the soundtrack, the writing, the voice cast , the animation, and everything else that made the 1986 Transformers movie so beloved by fans and non-fans alike. So lee's find out what made The original 1986 Transformers movie so 80s. 

The main reason what made the original Transformers movie so beloved was due to the awesome soundtrack that was created. The soundtrack consists some of the most 80s hair metal and rock music that you will ever hear in your life. the highlights of the soundtrack were ""The Touch"" and ""Dare"" sung by Stan Bush and boy he made the biggest 80s bangers of all time. ""The Touch"" was the most iconic song from the soundtrack because of how it became the anthem for the franchise. The score was composed by Vince DiCola who also composed the music for Rocky 4 and every track is fantastic. 

Overall, the 1986 Transformers movie is the most 80s movie ever created. I can say that this move is Transformers at its very highest peak of the franchise. ",88,117

Even though this is a 40 year old movie and even those those characters were elderly back then, they were supposed to be from the old money upper crust of Philadelphia society. As they noted, their family helped found the exchange they traded on, etc. It's not that they couldn't have been quite bigoted, -they were depicted as bad guys-but even back then that language was considered vulgar and  ""lower-class"" in a different way from ordinary profanity. It was NOT the same as men using crude language in private when ladies weren't present, which types like this might well have done.   Of course it was a comedy and not so realistic in all other respects (!), but this part struck me. I think young people watching it today might not realize that this part actually was a bit unrealistic.

While they are having sex, they are simultaneously trying to kill each other. I remember watching this movie and not knowing exactly what I was supposed to think. It was such a contrast from the original 300. I'm not normally a fan of sex scenes in movies, but the sex scene in the OG 300 made sense. He was about to go off to war with a handful of his soldiers and he knew he was definitely going to die... so why not have sex with your wife? The scene in Rise of an Empire though was completely different. I've heard of sexual tension, but trying to murder someone while you are simultaneously having sex with them just doesn't work....

A close second has to be the rave scene in The Matrix Reloaded (2003). A huge sweaty cave where everyone is having sex to rave music was definitely not the turn that I saw The Matrix movies going in.

*The Lawbreakers/The Long Arm*: Two epic films about the mutiny on the Bounty, based on the book *Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian* by Richard Hough. Work on the first script was from 1977 to 1978, and the first forty pages of the second script was from 1978 to 1979, until work was halted when Bolt was struck down with a stroke that impaired his speech and kept him Falstaffian for the rest of his life. Anthony Hopkins was set to play Captain Bligh (which he eventually did, in Bolt's condensed version, in 1982) and Christopher Reeve was set to play Fletcher Christian.

*Nostromo*: Based off the book by Joseph Conrad, in 1991 Lean set to work on what would have been his final film. He started work in the mid 1980s, riding the wave of the marvellous *A Passage to India* with *Les Liasons Dangereuses* dramatist Christopher Hampton, then Hampton decided to move on and he worked on it with Bolt again until 1991, when, just as filming was about to begin, Lean died. The cast would have included Peter O'Toole, Marlon Brando, Isabella Rossellini, Christopher Lambert, Dennis Quaid as the journalist Decoud and Georges Corraface as the eponymous title character.

Only a few movies manage to generate the same level of excitement both online and offline. Such movies typically become commercial blockbusters because they successfully draw people to theaters.

Take, for example, the recent movies The Fall Guy and Furiosa(both of which I loved). While they are receiving high praise online, most people I interact with in real life either didn't like them or had heard they weren't that great. These individuals rarely use social media. This is the same with many of my co-workers.

Are people expecting too much due to the rave online reviews, leading to disappointment when the movies don't meet their expectations? This seems to be the case, especially since the same individuals can't stop talking about how good Top Gun, Barbie, Dune and even Anyone but you were.

It seems that the hype on social media often creates high expectations that the actual movies can't always fulfill. This might explain why some recent films don't have huge opening weekends despite the online buzz.

Yet, this sentiment always seems to pop up whenever sex scenes get mentioned. Do sex scenes need to be in movies? Perhaps not, but does anything need to happen in a movie?

Here's an example: >!do Dread Pirate Roberts and Inigo Montoya have to fight in The Princess Bride (1989)? After all, Roberts could have easily knocked Montoya out as soon as he got up from the cliff. Yet the movie would lose out on not only one of the greatest fight scenes of all time but a decent bit of depth from the involved characters. !<

The point is: the ""plot"" in a movie, much like a book, play, or even an album, is determined based on whatever the filmmakers want to show. Sex happens; therefore, there will be depictions of it whether as a detail or as a major part of the story. I understand there will always be people who aren't interested in sex in general and that's fine, but it's strange that those particular audiences don't do the bare minimum and check if the movie they're interested in has a sex scene or not.

As for the all-mighty plot worshippers, I wonder what their opinion is on movies such as The Thing (1982), Blade Runner 2049 (2017) , or even Solaris (1972) where all three are nearly devoid of sex >!(2049 does have nudity though)!<, but are more than just a plot on a screen. Or even movies such as Oldboy (2003), Videodrome (1983), and Crash (1996) where sex is actually very important to the plot >!(that being said, in all three examples the audience is supposed to be uncomfortable)!<.

**For a  Fistful of Dollars** (1964) - Sergio Leones western remake of Kurosawa's Yojimbo (1961) not only kicked off a renaissance in the western genre, but remains one of its greatest entry's.

**Scarface** (1984) - Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone and Al Pacino converged to make one of the most iconic remakes in cinema, transporting Howard Hawks Scarface (1932) gangster epic from the cold austerity of  prohibition era Chicago to the sleazy and hedonistic streets of 1980's Miami.

**The Departed** (2006) - Scorsese oscar winning remake of Andrew Laus 2002 Infernal Affairs, transports a blistering tale of loyalty and betrayal from Hong Kong to Boston and doesn't miss a trick in doing so. Easily 1 of Scorese's best films in an already impressive catalogue.",30,0

Let me elaborate. ,"Many old classics are being remade today under the banner of ‚Äúmodernizing for a contemporary audience‚Äù and ‚Äúenhancing diversity and inclusivity,‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs a problematic trend. We've seen how reboots and sequels often fall flat‚Äîtake Star Wars, Ghostbusters, The Mummy, or many Disney remakes. In the pursuit of diversity and inclusivity, these stories sometimes lose their original meaning, depth, and essence. 

It's not fair to dismiss older films by blaming them for lacking inclusivity, especially when many of them are beloved for their storytelling and well-crafted characters. As a brown kid, I related to and connected with many characters regardless of their race or gender. Whether it was Tobey Maguire‚Äôs Spider-Man or Will Smith‚Äôs Agent J, these characters were so well-written and performed that they became irreplaceable. While some new versions, like other iterations of Spider-Man, have succeeded, others, such as the recent Men in Black reboot, seemed more focused on inclusivity than on the core elements that made the originals great.

The focus should be on writing good characters and compelling stories. Inclusivity and diversity are important, but they should complement rather than overshadow the narrative and character development. These aspects can be part of a character‚Äôs identity but shouldn‚Äôt be the main focus. Shows like House of the Dragon and Game of Thrones demonstrate how to balance diverse characters without compromising the story. What do you think? Do you agree or do you think this is a dogshit take?

Edit: Okay y‚Äôall, I know this is the most obvious take and what not. That‚Äôs what I thought too. But I‚Äôm writing this, cause I got ‚Äúattacked‚Äù for saying this, in a film class in a film school. I go to SCAD and the majority of my class came after me and got super offended that I said this! And I had myself questioning g me if I was too based or was I insane. So yeah‚Ä¶

Seriously, he should have an Oscar by now!!

His performance in First Reformed is easily one of the best of the last decade or the last fifteen years!!

He should get better and more high profile roles, especially since it's inexplicable to me how this film and acting industry seems to have a weird fascination for some average Mark Ruffalo, for god's sake, but doesn't care about Ethan Hawke.

Seriously, Scorsese, PTA, Spielberg, Fincher, Nolan Villeneuve, Gerwig, or whomever should hire him and give him more roles and put him in more films.

He's as great as the deeply esteemed contemporary actors of his time (DiCaprio, Phoenix, Bale, Gyllenhaal, Gosling, Hardy, Downey Jr, Fassbender, Murphy, etc..) and should be revered more by the film industry.

Sincerely, industry people, give this man an Oscar!!

I wouldn't say that, but I do think the upbeat music is an ironic choice that obscures the dark world the characters inhabit. They have nothing to do but drive aimlessly around and be destructive. Their lives aren't building to anything. The main characters are bullies and conformists and they perpetuate the cycle of violence (even the teachers are part of the system), but the only time this cycle is questioned is for a joke at the expense of the contextual weirdo, coded-gay character. People have compared it to American Graffiti, but that film embraces its more somber tone, or to Superbad, but that film is actually fun and funny. People rewatch this movie, but I found it tough to get through. It brought up all the pain I remember from being a teenager. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for those times. I was both a bully and bullied. I grew up in a small town. I did drugs and went to the occasional party. (although I didn't drive until after college). So I definitely relate to the setting and premise, but the film focuses on all the things about 
my small town that made me get out when I turned 18 and cut ties with most of the burnout townies I knew. Just the utter hopelessness and myopia. I can't really understand why people look back on times like these with such rosy glasses. That's what the film seems to do, but I can't quite determine if it's genuine or ironic.

Some well known favourites of mine would be:

‚Ä¢ Hallway Fight - Oldboy: I love the sombre atmosphere and gloomy soundtrack, the 2D perspective and the raw brutality and griminess that this scene presents. Apparently it took three days to film!

‚Ä¢ Church Fight - Kingsman Secret Service: The whole movie is cheesy and this scene is just the icing on the cake. It balances humour with ultra violence, using exaggerated proportions and quick moments. And the Freebird guitar solo in the background is just iconic!

‚Ä¢ Museum - John Wick 3: Parabellum: When you watch John Wick you know you‚Äôre in for a treat. Maybe they aren‚Äôt great plots, but they are exciting movies. This scene is right near the beginning in a hallway full of antique weapons. The choreography is quick, precise and relentless. 

‚Ä¢ The Polecats - Mad Max: Fury Road: Somehow the action in this movie never gets tiring and always shocks me with new ideas. Near the end of the film is this tightly edited scene with many massive moving set pieces. I love how I can follow the flow of action and camera shots without being confused.

What are some of yours?

‚ÄúWhen nuclear Armageddon destroys civilization on Earth, the only survivors are those on the 12 international space stations in orbit at the time.

Desperately looking for a solution, the ark's leaders send 100 juvenile prisoners back to the planet to test its habitability. Having always lived in space, the exiles find the planet fascinating and terrifying, but with the fate of the human race in their hands, they must forge a path into the unknown.‚Äù

If anyone‚Äôs seen it, let‚Äôs talk!

I thought it was strangely the most normal movie I‚Äôve ever seen. Despite the surrealist aspects of it, it didn‚Äôt feel odd or out of place or even creepy. It felt like the daydreams of someone with depression or suicidality ‚Äì as I have fought and continue to fight both, it felt like it hit close to home, but not so close or so dark that it would trigger an episode or take me out of the story. The story hinging on a single introvert dealing with those thoughts felt really nice to be represented on screen, and nothing about plot or acting or cinematography broke the illusion that I was just watching the life of an absolutely ordinary person.

It's not supported by the script or the imagery.,"Max is the perspective character, the character who develops the most internally, and--contrary to popular belief--[has the most screen-time.](https://www.screentimecentral.com/beyond-the-oscars)

It‚Äôs true that Furiosa is a protagonist of Fury Road ‚Äì but she‚Äôs the co-protagonist. The film is built around the development of her relationship with Max from distrust to allyship ‚Äì and how this brings Max back from cynical, animalistic survivor to redeemed hero.

Consider the turning point in the film (the second act break), when the group decides to turn around and fight their way to the citadel (1:28). This turning point is not driven by Furiosa‚Äì but by Max‚Äôs choice to hope again. He changes his mind and reaches out to her (1:26).

It‚Äôs not a coincidence that this turning point concludes with an image of Max and Furiosa clasping their hands together, either. So many of the defining images and scenes in the film center around the development of this relationship.

There‚Äôs the hand-to-hand fight at (0:30) which establishes this relationship with distrust and violence. The canyon escape where Furiosa trusts Max to drive and Max hands her weapons (0:54). The sniper sequence where Max gives up the gun to Furiosa (1:09). The scene where Furiosa keeps Max from falling (1:37). Or when Max serves as a blood donor to save Furiosa (1:48). The final images of the film are duo staring back at one another in acknowledgement and respect (1:52-1:53)

Even Furiosa's most personal moments are linked to Max through the images. The scene where she breaks down in the desert ends with a lingering image of Max watching Furiosa's anguish (1:22).

The ultimate irony of this criticism is that it's often paired with longing for the old Mad Max films... Like Road Warrior, which is told from another character's perspective and doesn't give Max much of an internal arc.

I love the older films but Fury Road explores Max's internal psychology more rigorously than any of them outside of the very first one. This criticism doesn't hold up to actual analysis.",36,0

When I heard about that film, the only thing I learned was of the main cast, and Emma Stone's character Bella gets screwed...a lot. I thought this was going to be a sleaze fest that somehow got critical acclaim until January, when it finally came to my local theaters, I tossed caution to the wind and sate my morbid curiosity. Sure enough, it was a raunchy movie but way more than that: a barrel of laughs, a wonderful surreal score, a beautiful steampunk meets Dr. Seuss world, fantastic performances by Stone, Dafoe, and Ruffalo. It was perfect save a small pacing nitpick in the film.

I talked with a buddy of mine who I found out was a film buff and he recommended me The Lobster which I also enjoyed. When I heard reviews for Kinds of Kindness saying it was like Yorgos' earlier, sardonic films I went to watch Dogtooth which put the director on the map, which I also enjoyed.

I see a commonality between his films 3 movies in: Sex (the scenes are played for comedy or are intentionally unsexy which takes a talent), dark/surreal comedy (absurd situations no matter how improbable are played so straight), and...dogs at some point having an appearance. Raunchy, dark and surreal comedy are my type of humor which is probably the reason why I like what he has so far.

To elaberate; my problem with the rape plotline was that I feel David not finding out was a mistake; it could've led to some interesting character moments and I think it's a shame that Amy doesn't regain her power by partaking more in the climax: eg. She should've tied Scutt up and later killed him, or she should've thrown one of the pans of hot oil in Charlie's face.",56,24

Wow, what an all-timer. She is completely unrecognizable in that role. She completely disappears and immerses herself into studying the psyche of a serial killer. She toes that fine line between sympathy and disgust for Aileen Wuornos. The final look that she gives.....ugh, chills down my spine. What makes her performance even better is that the film as a whole is just.....fine. It's harder to do good work when you're not surrounded by other good work. She very deservingly won an Academy Award for this. And what's more, she did this role because people were just taking her as a ""pretty face"" and not an actress who had real acting chops.

I apologize for being years late but before this week I had never seen or read anything Twilight. My wife convinced me to watch the movies with her since I'd never seen them. She told me they were bad, and I figured they weren't cinematic masterpieces but were perfectly fine movies, but boy I was not prepared. 

The first Twilight movie came out the year I entered high school, so I grew up hearing about Twilight constantly. I jumped on the hate train a little bit and that's why I never saw or read them apart from not really being interested. But as I got older I figured it was just a silly hate bandwagon and a bit sexist. I figured Twilight would probably be a generational franchise that millennial moms like to watch with their daughters. Kinda like Star Wars or Harry Potter. 

I don't think that anymore haha, the movie hate was all justified. I've watched the first two and am not excited for the rest.

Having not read the books the movies provide an interesting experience of not doing a good job of explaining or showing things so everything feels rushed and undeserved, while simultaneously being boring with a slow moving plot where not a ton happens. Every line of dialogue is cheesy, poorly written, and badly acted. (Today is the big day, Bella. R and J essay due) And there's just so. much. cringe. (What if I'm the bad guy?)

I was able to enjoy the first one by making fun of it constantly with my wife as we watched it, it was bad in a fun way. But New Moon was even worse and wasn't as enjoyable to make fun of.

How did Twilight catch such a hold of a generation? Also why where middle aged moms flocking to the theaters salivating over these characters? Is the bar for romance movies really this low? Have we as a society since raised our expectations?",52,0

It's a dramedy about two cousins who reconnect on a Holocaust history tour after their grandmother passes away and leaves them some money to go on the trip and get back together. The film is ultimately a clash of their personalities as Eisenberg is the classic overworked overachiever and Culkin is the carefree goofball; classic stuff, it all works.

I was just looking at Fandango and see a listing for a film called Treasure, starring Lena Dunham and Stephen Fry, with this premise; ""A father-daughter road trip set in 1990s Poland, TREASURE follows Ruth (Dunham), an American music journalist, and her father, Edek (Fry), a charmingly stubborn Holocaust survivor, on a journey to his homeland. While Ruth is eager to make sense of her family's past, Edek embarks on the trip with his own agenda. This emotional, funny culture clash of two New Yorkers exploring post-socialist Poland is a powerful example of how reconnecting with family and the past can be an unexpected treasure.""

Does anybody know if there was anything written about this? Like which of these was in production first or if there was any overlap? I know this has happened before with similar premises but this just feels way too specific to be a coincidence.",2,1

My fianc√© and I are getting married this fall, and our venue is a former movie theater. It still has the marquees on the front wall and we can use our engagement photos as posters in those marquees. We're wanting to turn our photos into movie style posters, so we're looking for movie titles or quotes that we could use in the designs.

Does anyone have any ideas that would work for this? It could be from any romcom, drama, comedy, etc. We'd just like them to be fairly recognizable to our guests. Here are some of the ones we've come up with so far:

-When (my name) Met (her name)

-Sleepless in (our city)

-Meet the (my last name)'s

-10 Things I Love About You

-When a Man Loves a Woman

Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",19,5

The film does a good job in a general way explaining the gowth of the porn industry, and mentions she played cards with Bonanno capo Mickey Zaffarano every Friday night in her apartment above the Eros Theater on Eighth Ave. She named all her theaters - The Adonis, Eros, Venus, etc. - after Greek gods.

2 Was considered for the role of Charley Varrick but turned down the role because he could find no redeeming qualities in the character. 


3 Did not want to do any more Dirty Harry films after the enforcer 1976 which was intended to be the last film. However after a poll was held in 1983 for a potential new Dirty Harry film,  and Private agreements with the studio allowed him to do more personal films in exchange for the subsequent sequels.  A 6th Dirty Harry film was also rumored but was disapproved by Eastwood for being too dark, it was later made into ricochet with Denzel Washington.   


4 Nicknamed Samson by hospital nurses because he weighed 11 pounds and 6 inches at birth.  

5 Every which way but loose was not originally written for him. Eastwood was supposed to pass the script to Burt Reynolds but he liked it so much he ended up doing it himself even though he was warned it could kill his career. 

6 Owned the rights to the novel nothing lasts forever, for a short period of time which later became die hard.

7. Was considered for his version of Rambo at one point before Sylvester was cast.

We purchased this [limited edition 4k on Arrow](https://www.arrowvideo.com/wild-things-limited-edition-4k-uhd/13675343.html) some time ago and finally brought it out this Memorial Day weekend. 

While I know we had seen it a loooong time ago, probably a Blockbuster rental, because I am a huge [Neve Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neve_Campbell?wprov=sfti1) fan and have been since [Party of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Five?wprov=sfti1).  It did not really ring too much of a bell as we started to watch.  

Roger Ebert described this film as ‚Äúlurid trash‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äùa softcore sex film, a soap opera and a B-grade noir‚Äù and he‚Äôs not wrong. 
The setting was absolutely gorgeous. When we first saw the film I had not been to Florida, nor had I put in my 14 years of living in South East Texas, where you can peel the summer air off starting in May all the way through November.  The line between the haves and the have-nots is not one you cross, not back in 1998, and not now. 

Kelly Van Ryan has everything she could ever want.  Suzie Toller is a delinquent. They both go to school where the guidance counselor, handsome and young Sam Lambardo, works. They get into a bit of a mess, the three of them, and what exactly happened, and why it happened, remains unclear. 

Detective Ray Duquette and his partner, Gloria Perez investigate the situation and try to figure out who did what to whom.  The story twists, turns, and goes so many directions that by the end, you are still wondering if something else will end up coming to light. 

The acting was not great, especially on the parts of the supporting cast. It was alternatively soap-opera over dramatic to as wooden as a puppet. 

Filmed at Ransom Everglades High School in Coconut Grove, Miami, due to the school's architecture and scenic setting. The film also captured the natural splendor in Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park in Key Biscayne and Oleta River State Park.  The clarity and color that comes through in the 4k makes it worth the cost of the limited edition, for sure. 

Zedd and I discussed the film and he noted that it was clear that the actors obviously knew what they were filming was a bit of a cinematic joke, but that they approached it with a lightness and sense of humor that is difficult to find these days, no one was taking themselves too seriously. 

I agree, a teacher doing what Lombardo was accused of doing would probably not be the subject of a sexy film these days.  Certainly not one with a threesome, nor so much nudity of ‚Äúteen girls‚Äù in a mainstream, big release like this. 

Without giving too much away, the film is fast-paced, beautifully filmed, and worth a watch. We are not by any means talking cinematic masterpiece, it‚Äôs definitely a fun way to spend an afternoon. 

Zedd and I have a rule that if we add a film to the collection that has a theatrical and an extended (director‚Äôs, unrated, etc.) edition, that we watch the theatrical cut first. So we are looking forward to watching the ‚Äúunrated‚Äù version later this summer, as this sure as heck feels like a hot, sultry, late summer film. 

Meanwhile, after a Memorial Day weekend that included heat indexes of 116 degrees, Zedd and I will continue to ***Movie On*** through our own ‚Äúhibernation period‚Äù here in South East Texas, from just about May to November, we really lean on our movie collection as it becomes entirely inhospitable outside.  Peel off the air, indeed!

Most weeks have seen at least one new release that is positively received. The clunkers like Madame Web and Argylle have been few and far between. It finally feels like we are in a post-Superhero dominance era, with a good mix of franchises that aren't beat to death and non-franchise films getting enough space to breath at the box office. Even some mid-budget movies like Challengers, Monkey Man, and Civil War have had more marketing attention than they would have in previous years. I'd make a case that 2024 has been the best post-pandemic year for movies so far.

Unfortunately, the general public have voted with their wallet by not going to the movies. Which is going to send a very clear message to studios about the kinds of movies that they want to push. A decade from now, we might look back at 2024 as a very underappreciated year with a good amount of cult classics and hidden gems. We might also remember it as the reason why studios only push safe brands.",24,0

I'm sure many people know somebody did a brilliant job of recutting the entire movie from Aurora/Jennifer Lawrence's perspective which makes it much creepier  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/6bbnn3/redditor\_reedits\_the\_entire\_passengers\_movie\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/6bbnn3/redditor_reedits_the_entire_passengers_movie_into/)

But I've also seen some new ideas such as:  
-Jim woke up other women before Aurora and killed them  
-Jim shows an even creepier side and starts interfering with the ship to get at Aurora  
-Jim becomes enraged and starts trying to break open numerous pods on the ship and Aurora tries to stop him  
-Jim dies and Aurora contemplates the same decision

So imagine this for a Passengers remake:  
-Movie takes place from Aurora's perspective, she wakes up earlier, friendly but creepy Jim has been awake for a year already, they fall in love, she discovers the truth (and eventually a few recap scenes showing Jim waking up and making his decision)  
-Throughout the movie, some empty pods of women who look similar to Aurora are seen and repeated hints are dropped but never confirmed Jim might have had something to do with this... but maybe they were people who didn't make it on the ship, we never know...  
-Later on there are hints Jim is interfering with the ship, seemingly not coping with only talking to Arthur, possibly spying on Aurora, coming across her in the ship under suspicious circumstances, possibly disabling her door in a jealous rage after she rebuffs him  
-Aurora eventually confronts him and he loses his mind and starts smashing open pods on the ship with an axe, numerous people run around in confusion and terror and chaos unfolds, eventually the ship's air supply is breached by accident or deliberately and the whole ship goes down  
-The movie returns to Aurora waking from a nightmare, its unclear how much of what just happened was part of the dream, there should be some hints dropped that this was an alternate future true to the characters nature (Jim or Aurora could do and say similar things in later scenes to hint it was an alternate timeline)  
-Lawrence Fishburn wakes up (and there are some hints that he knows Jim did something even worse than waking Aurora up). Jim and Aurora eventually save the ship, except in this case Jim dies in the process.   
Aurora finds a video confession he was going to give to her where he acknowledges he is disgusted with himself, that he didn't want to be the person become and he's sorry (this apology should be open enough to fit with theories that he's a serial killer or was interfering with the ship to stalk or control her).  
The movie ends with Aurora contemplating whether to wake up somebody else up.",2,0

I've noticed a  trend in movie marketing that seems destined for failure. Take the examples of ***Furiosa*** and ***Fall Guy***. Their promotional efforts have been dominated by the two main actors doing interviews, often discussing everything but the actual movie. Beyond an initial trailer, the bulk of the marketing has been more about the actors' personal lives, their other projects, and generic industry talk rather than the films themselves.

For ***Furiosa***, outside of its first trailer, which faced criticism for its CGI compared to ***Fury Road***, the focus has remained squarely on the actors. We‚Äôve seen them on a world tour, chatting about everything under the sun except for the movie's plot, themes, or what makes it worth watching. This kind of marketing is not what audiences care about anymore. Honestly, it never worked for me, but it's clear that this old strategy is now more ineffective than ever.

On the other hand, consider the marketing for movies like *Planet of the Apes*. The promotion has been centered around the movie's story and its unique elements. This kind of marketing sparks interest and makes potential viewers consider a trip to the cinema and I believe the current sales reflect this.

Going to the movies is no longer just about filling free time. Given the high cost of movie tickets and food, people have to make a deliberate decision to go out and watch a film. With almost everyone having a streaming setup and at least a decent-sized 55-inch TV, movies need to sell themselves better to lure audiences away from their homes and into the cinema.

If the current state of cinemas and ticket pricing is not getting better with further hikes in the US for example, then marketing strategies need to evolve. Right now, when movies fail, the excuses and blame are misplaced. It‚Äôs time for a change in how films are promoted, focusing more on the stories and less on the stars if they want us to get off our couches and invest again in the cinema.",21,0

I guess that was changed to heighten the emotion of the film so you're rooting for Henri, but it may have been more interesting to weigh up a genuine criminal receiving horrific treatment. It's obviously wrong either way, but would've made it harder to root for him. 

Another change was making Henri kill McCain with a spoon rather than a knife - seems an odd choice and not really sure what the point of this was other than to make it more interesting/somewhat humorous but it doesn't seem like the right type of subject matter for that..

Also in the film Henri is killed by the guards when he returns to Alcatraz - surely this makes no sense firstly sending him back there instead of somewhere else, and secondly on the guards' part as they're just about to be investigated so it's pretty obvious what happened.. In reality Henri lived on and jumped parole in 1972, his whereabouts after that are unknown...",0,1

movies,t3_1d2v2yv,1716931584.0,/r/movies/comments/1d2v2yv/collateral_2004_and_the_passenger_2023_are/,Discussion,"""Collateral"" (2004) and ""The Passenger"" (2023) are essentially the same narrative and I think both of them are great films. ","So I recently finally saw the film ""Collateral"" by Michael Mann after having it for a while in my watch list and besides the questionable production quality, I really enjoyed this movie. I think the main performances of Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are pretty fantastic and it adds up to the interaction of their relationships and much of the criminal activities they get involved with along with a surprisingly introspective message about finally taking the actions necessary to improve yourself and your life through the danger of being held hostage to a contract killer. The action is also very good in the film too.

But anyways, I wanna talk specifically about how these two films are very, very similar even if I do think they do have certain differences from each other. Here are the details of the overall main aspects of the story:

_‚Ä¢ Both of them are stories about socially awkward male protagonists who are pretty much stuck doing unsatisfying jobs which brings them a sense of safety in their lives but ultimately makes them feel there's something missing about themselves by just living through this status quo enforced on themselves and further encouraged by the employees/employers of their workplace who do much respect for them (The protagonist in ""Collateral"" is a taxi driver who wants to start up his limo company but doesn't take the further steps to go ahead with it and instead focuses on doing his part-time job; The protagonist in ""The Passenger"" is a young man working in a dead-end job as a crew member for some unknown fast food restaurant after being responsible for causing a teacher to lose her eye when he was a child due to becoming mad at that time.)_

_‚Ä¢ They have a talk with one of the characters (Annie Farrell and the boss) during their job who ask them about what they do/plan to do besides just wanting to do what they're currently doing and the main protagonists kinds vaguely express that they have some plans to do something about themselves which leaves their conversation in a comfort zone where they don't feel pressured enough to really think about what they should do with themselves even despite having an insightful conversation in which the characters might have to feel obligated to do more._

_‚Ä¢ Eventually, they have this encounter with the main villains of the series (Vincent and Benson) who are presented at first to be friendly to the main protagonists (Vincent is willing to pay Max extra if he decides to do stops to many locations throughout the night and Benson defends Randy from the employees bullying him) but eventually, they would soon present a darker side of themselves by killing someone/multiple people in the process._

_‚Ä¢ After this occurs, both villains take the protagonists hostage in cars in which they drive around the city/town where they make multiple stops in which the villain just needs to do something or to try to take him somewhere where they force the protagonists to do something in order to help them confront their sense of inaction while ironically not allowing them to have much of a choice in the matter as this isn't really about helping them even though they pretend to help them but instead, there is something a bit more personal and selfish underneath their actions which the antagonists never make exactly clear but from what it is implied, these characters have some traumatic experience in their past and are not putting those very same standards on themselves and will grow more hostile if you question their orders (Vincent is asked by Max about why he kills the people that he kills and why is he a contract killer in the first place, which Vincent refuses to truly answers and explains the abuse at the hands of his father, which may be part of the reason he decided to take this job; Benson is himself not willing to talk about how he seems to be a very angry person and about why he decided to beat up that male teacher who may have been responsible of some form of abuse in his childhood.)_

_‚Ä¢ Both protagonists are also forces by the protagonists to meet with a old friend/relative (Max's mom and Randy's ex girlfriend) as a way of encouraging to confront a problem going through their lives directly related to why they work the jobs they do and why they're so passive and shy in nature._

_‚Ä¢ At first, in these attempts to help them confront themselves, they act too insecure about expressing the truth about why they are the way that they are but overtime, they would develop greater confidence to speak up not just about these issues but also use this newfound confidence to confront the main antagonists in such a way that they nearly sacrifice their lives in the attempts to escape from them._

_‚Ä¢ Throughout this character development, the antagonists would threaten the lives of important women  (Annie and the teacher who lost her eye.).
 who matter to them who contribute to their change in some way to make the next step to furthering their life and they woukd come to redeem themselves from their inaction for the deaths going around them by protecting them._

_‚Ä¢ The antagonists present some hesitance about killing them because of their supposed contract with each other but the protagonists would defeat using this previous trust they've had and eventually lead them to their deaths where they die from gunshots (Vincent dies getting shot at by Max and Benson dies by willingly allowing him to get shot at by the police waiting outside to arrest him.)_

_‚Ä¢ In the end, they go together with the female characters who grow a special bond even after all the danger they've been through partially because of them and is implied that they're taking the path for self-improvement._

I'm not sure if this may be more common in other films but having seen these two, they do remind me of each other a lot.

I think some of the difference is that for Randy, his change is about accepting responsibility for causing harm to someone and obtain a closure so his guilt doesn't keep feeding on his mind while for Max, it is about doing the job that he really wants rather than keep being a taxi driver. And Benson decides to kill not as a job but directly because he wants to give the protagonist a lesson as he is able to something about him that he can find himself. Benson also doesn't try to kill Randy even after he betrays him but instead, accepts his fate through suicide and ends in a tragic note in which he explains how he wasn't strong enough to move on from his trauma. Benson also is the one who does the driving in his car while Max is the one who transports Vincent to the places he needs to go.

I may be missing some other details but this is what I got overall so far. I'm curious if ""The Passenger"" is at least in some way influenced by this movie. Both great films and I got something of value about what they had to express. ",4,0

I've  watched Fall Guy, Kingdom of the Planet of The Apes, and Furiosa in the last month and i swear I came out of each one a little frustrated that otherwise fantastic movies are falling into the same trap of 3rd acts that just drag the film. I might even put Dune 2 in that group as well, even though I love that movie.

It's not that the 3rd act is overly long, like in the case of Kingdom and Dune 2, it's more that the 3rd act is squished into the end of an already long film and doesn't seem to know where to actually roll the credits. 

My conspiracy theory is that now that movies are getting streaming releases, studios and directors are less willing to trim fat and redundancy, because a longer film means more app engagement. Idk if that tracks but its just my idea.

I have just finished this film and I have really enjoyed it, it's quite good.

I have a question though, I wonder if anyone else thought about this.  The critics and public are talking about the film as if it talks just about a simple life, a simple person who enjoy what he does and lives the present even if lives kind of precarious, like in a different age and time ( 80s?)

So the point is, I think that actually he was an alcoholic at some point in the past, as the way he ends drinking the beer it's kind of an alcoholic way, but also this started his bad relationship with his father ( or that relation is what started the addiction) and just talking about him made him very sad and crying.

He then after being a homeless alcoholic like that crazy guy who wanders arounds, he could start a new life as a cleaner living in a poor house, something that doesn't fit with his discipline as he seemed to have been raised educated in a wealthier family.

Does this make sense to anyone? Something really bad that happend to him in the 80s or 90s made him stuck on that time period. The film sometimes make slight references to Trainspotting which is a film about junkies in the 80s, so is the character some sort of an old ex alcoholic ex junkie?

published in 2008 and written by fantasy legend neil gaiman, the graveyard book tells a very unique story. after the murder of his parents, a baby winds up in a graveyard. over the course of his life, he is raised by the ghosts of the graveyard. over the course of the story, the boy(named nobody) starts to grow as a person and gain more independence. meanwhile, his parent's murderer has gotten wise to the fact that nobody is still alive and hunts him down. 

a very interesting premise that seems ripe for adaptation. sadly, there has yet to be an adaptation of the graveyard book. but it's not for lack of trying. 

in 2009, one year after the book's publication, crying game director neil jordan signed onto direct a live action adaptation of the book. the film was to be produced and distributed by miramax. however, no such film ever materialized.

then, in 2012, walt disney pictures acquired the rights to the book and planned to make an animated adaptation with coraline director henry sellick helming production. this ended up falling through and the project moved to pixar instead. if the film had been made, it would have been pixar's first adaptation of previously existing source material. eventually though, the pixar project ended up falling through as well.

in 2013, ron howard was attached to direct an adaptation but he dropped out due to his commitment to other projects. since then, the project has remained in development hell.

but all is not lost. in 2022, christopher robin director marc forestor signed onto direct a feature film adaptation with life of pi writer david magee writing the screenplay. only time will tell if this attempt goes anywhere.",0,0

For those that don‚Äôt know, CPTSD is caused by prolonged trauma, often as children from close relationships like family. The movie shows how this kind of ongoing trauma can deeply affect people. The characters deal with chronic emotional pain, relationship struggles, hypervigilance, and unhealthy coping mechanisms, which are all signs of CPTSD.

The film does an excellent job of illustrating how the father's behavior and the family dynamics contributed to prolonged trauma in his children. It made me reflect on how CPTSD often stems from those closest to us and how the effects can be so pervasive that we might not even recognize them in ourselves.

Watching the characters deal with chronic emotional pain, relationship struggles, hypervigilance, and unhealthy coping mechanisms highlighted the insidious nature of CPTSD. It got me thinking about how many people might not even realize they're impacted by CPTSD because it becomes part of their 'normal' due to their upbringing.

I‚Äôm curious, have any of you had similar experiences where you recognized symptoms of CPTSD in this movie or other media?

**Spoiler**

Also, it‚Äôs inspiring to think about the few who manage to recognize these patterns and break the cycle, like Kevin Von Erich did in the movie. That last scene with his boys, where you could see he would be a better parent to his sons than the parents he had, was really powerful. Those that find truth will inevitably find pain, but they are also the few given the rare opportunity to break the cycle and bring life for others.

To be honest, I saw a lot of warnings about disturbing the actual content itself is - and it is disturbing, without a doubt. But one of the most jarring aspects of the film is that, for a majority of the film, there is utter chaos and noise. Even the little music that there is (if you can call it that) is dissonant and rattling to the ears. It's a constant, unrelenting battering noise. The only silence fills you with absolute dread because you are terrified of what is coming. For me it redefined what war really is. I'm pretty reasonable, I know what war entails. I do not. I do not understand never having a single moment to think or rest or recoup because it's the left and right of me, above and below me, there is just discord at all times. What anxiety that would cause. How it renders a child incapable of imagination, thought, studying, and reflection. Things that are the rights of every single child. There is no hopeful soundtrack, no moving orchestral swell of reassurance. There are just engines, machine gun fire, threats, and screaming. Every minute of everyday. I took to learning a foreign language and got to know people who lived through the USSR occupation of Eastern Europe. I have a renewed admiration for those who have had to live through even a fraction of this. No matter what side of a war you sit on, you have to really consider the damage that is done to an entire budding generation because of this constant state of heightened awareness. This should be a required watch in all history classes. I can't say many films have radicalized me, but this one did. It is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, and I never want to see it again.  ",38,121

","I know people think this film is apolitical and are irritated by left and right interpretations, and it's about journalism, which it is. For sure. I don't give a shit about politics and I'm a white guy that doesn't any kind of agenda, I'm not even American. I generally despise conversations about people looking too far into art/media but this film has the ol' wheels turning.

So I drank the Koolaid so you don't have to, and will present a case, I don't necessarily believe all of this but here's how the full Pepe Silvia / Charlie argument would go.

TLDR: there's a good amount of implied evidence that the Civil War in the film is somewhat connected to a wider race war. Would only be apt since the first Civil War was kind of about race... or was that just... state's rights (to WHAT?).


***Hotel Bar Scene***

Sammy: ""And you can't get anywhere near Philly. So you gotta go west, maybe as far as Pittsburgh.""

Question is why can't we go anywhere near a city that's still in the loyalist part of the US? It's 700 miles from the front lines, and thousands of miles away from the successionist states, so what's going on? (43% of Philly identifies as black, the most in PA.)

Sammy: ""But... you gonna make me explain why I have to be there?""

Why the fuck does Sammy have to BE THERE in particular? Job security? Both Lee and Joe don't have a response and look semi-ashamed after he says this, they then agree to take him to Charlottesville, he is 100% fearful of going near Washington, possibly because he's big boned.

***Road Trip Through PA***

Impartial counterpoint: on the way out of NY into PA, a few of the checkpoint soldiers are indeed black or POC - but these are possibly just militarized police, conscripted MPs or National Guard, the Gov't is getting squashed in the war and probably aren't sparing real manpower to lowly checkpoint posts.

Sammy: ""You don't wanna miss this"" - he has Jesse look to up at the road - the US version of the highway of death in PA - Sammy damn well knows it's coming up (cars are pointing West - the direction they're travelling, likely on the Westbound road out of Philadelphia toward Pittsburgh. (digital highway sign says MINES AHEAD).

This is possibly an allusion to the infamous (in the 90s and 2000s at least) ""Highway of Death"" from the Gulf War, US/UK/Canada/French forces destroyed some 3000 mostly stolen Kuwaiti fleeing vehicles on the road from Kuwait to Basra mostly by airpower.) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway\_of\_Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_of_Death)

So WHY were these people in particular targeted when other cities and people seem to functioning? These people weren't WF, maybe just sympathizers. They were clearly fleeing and stopped by force, fleeing from Philly going west?

Impartial counterpoint: Two looters strung up (and shot off screen) are white.

Sammy suggests hardball questions Joel should ask the President, obviously he's thought a lot about what he'd like to ask him himself but for some reason can't go to DC himself (possibly he's too big boned)

Sammy: ""State of the nation is QED""? (Don't know what this means)

***Hawaiian Shirt Militia scene***

Like 80% of the Hawaiian shirt militia are POC. They execute a (white) wounded solider on sight and very happily machine gun three of the captives (white). This is the literal definition of a war crime. Joel is seen having a good laugh with the ""war criminal henchman"" afterward, the others are nonplussed as usual. But Joel is characterized as a generally good dude, so what gives?

***Stadium Refugee Camp***

Most people in the refugee camp stadium are POC, like 90%. No where anywhere does it say this, and it's a stretch, but is this a cordoned off ghetto? This can't be geographically far from idyllic pristine white town scene that comes next. The girl that lets them in looks like a volunteer, UNICEF type person, so maybe not.

Through exposition, Jesse's and Lee's parents are revealed to be back home on a farm 'pretending it's not happening'.  They're white and possibly don't have an existential stake in this war for whatever reason.

***Idyllic Town in West Virginia***

All white, where are the POC? Sammy doesn't go in to the shop for whatever reason and leans against the truck on the curbside, physically covering his big bones from the line of fire from the two snipers on the roof, the camera pans up to reveal they've been watching him closely. He says be subtle when he asks Lee to take a look, then asks her ""you actually bought something?"". But not in a judgmental tone, just one of mild surprise. Lee says this is everything she'd forgotten (normalcy) and Sammy says it's everything he's remembered (people watching him with suspicion).

At this point the 'all white townspeople' dispels the notion that Garland just casted random extras for all the scenes. For me at least.

***Meth Damon and the Genocide Boys***

Meth Damon and the two guys are using 3 military earth movers, the SUV they captured (Hong Kong guy and Jesse) was forcibly parked and detained off camera just out front of a nicely kept estate with a freshly mowed lawn, the secret mass graves are literally in the backyard. This means the ""secret"" mass graves are mostly in plain sight.

From a distance Joel guesses they're ""not government forces, not up here"". Implying they're too far from the front line to be an active Gov't unit. So they're possibly deserters or extreme (very extreme) far right local civilian LARPers. Possibly taking advantage of the chaos and having a good laugh while ethnically cleansing their neighborhood.

However they have a CIB patch and SSI on their left shoulders which imply at least the uniforms are Gov't military. Nametags/rank/etc, are stripped from their uniforms and they don't seem to be enforcing much of a dress code, hence the sexy non-reg glasses. So they've been operating without oversight for a good while.

All of the people in the dump truck bed being dumped into the mass grave are POC.

Here's a stretch - they could be the far right US Gov't version of the Einsatzgruppen (Nazi death squads). [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen) The Nazis tended to choose real hardliners for these units, guys who violently put down prison revolts, etc., seems within character with Meth Damon.

The first execution is the most obvious POC - no questions asked. Next is Joel, while facing execution, Joel pauses and is trembling when he's compelled to say he's from Florida, which the audience expects will seriously piss off Meth Damon because Florida is a (fucking) successionist state leading an insurrection against the US government.

Meth Damon replies 'central', as in ""Central America"", implying he cares more about Joel's ethnicity than the fact he's hailing from a literal enemy state.

Meth Damon gives the two white people (Jesse and Lee) free passes for being from Colorado and Missouri. American. Then shoots guy from China. The mass grave is full of POC, including lots of women, women weren't spared on account of them being women, but white. Post scene exposition regarding what the holy fuck just happened is completely missing because Sammy is dying and because of Sturgill Simpson.

There's definitely a kindergartener in the mass grave.

Counterpoint: Some people in the grave look potentially white/have white people looking hair.

My takeaway is that they're just a side effect of the chaos and lawlessness near the front - they're what the farthest of the far right neo nazis would do -  Even the reporters haven't seen anything this bad, the underestimate it.

Counterpoint - If Garland wanted us to think they were legit, Govt forces carrying out policy he'd have out them in full kit, full name badges, receiving orders from superiors, etc. Clear decision here to leave the fundamental reasons ambiguous, but 100% racially motivated.

Why don't the journalists know any better? They don't know shit about the war.

At the hotel scene Sammy, a New York Times reporter, says the WF supply lines are collapsing and they are operating in anarchy, competition with one another, and will turn on themselves once the war is over. Totally not true when we see finally see the WF FOB, even reporters have been fed propaganda and don't know shit what's going on out there. There doesn't seem to be a functioning Internet anywhere on the road, outside of the hotel, which is slow and prone to disconnects (probably firewalled worse than China's).

***After Sturgill Simpson***

Super ambiguous - Lee says ""it may sound fucked up there were so many ways it could have ended for him, and a lot of them a lot worse. He didn't want to quit."" Why does Sammy have horrifying potential deaths and not the rest of them? Big bones?

***White House***

Presidents staffers and staff in the Beast are white. Secret service all seem white, I didn't rewatch this part closely so don't quote me.

Counterpoint - Press Secretary ? who tries to negotiate the President's extradition is black. However, the black lady WF soldier is the only person the squad allows to speak to her, the others don't interrupt, and she is the only person to open fire on her - a single shot, no backup fire or doubletapping. Why? At no point is she leading the squad so why does she speak for them? Seems like an very specific and intentional decision by the director.

Counterpoint - Before she dies, he requests the President's extradition to a neutral territory - Greenland or Alaska - Alaska isn't part of the US anymore (Alaska has been solely run by Republicans since the 1960s, and is only 4% black)

***The most telling point of the film:***

The three ""Navy Seals"" and the other WF Forces holding the President at gunpoint are white, except for WF black lady. The black WF soldier is allowed to fire the only two execution shots. The others don't jump the gun or ask if they can be the hero who pulls the trigger, or fire additional shots.

Imagine how thirsty Seal Team 6 was to be the guy who shot fucking Bin Laden. Why did Garland write this so only the black female soldier gets the kills shot?

No, my favorite comes from ""One Crazy Summer"", the similarly quirky follow-up of John Cusack and director Savage Steve Holland to their cult classic ""Better Off Dead."" Siskel and Ebert gave that film a negative review. So in retribution, Holland depicted them in ""One Crazy Summer"" as a pair of cartoon bunnies who get blown up Wil E. Coyote-style at film's end (it makes sense in the context of the film). The Ebert bunny in particular is unmistakable, featuring Roger's hair, sweater, glasses and figure and even munching on candy.

ive read/ watched through explanation threads and explanation video, but there are still some things i want to figure out:

1. what is the point of arrranging the character of sylvia? we learned that christof is a powerful and a formidable figure, and he has the power to control almost everything, and all those people around truman are paid actors. Sylvia is definitely one of the few people that genuinely cares about truman. So is she simply a justicial character who rebel against the antagonist, and Christof has no idea that she will rebel against him?
2. also whats the point of making truman meet his "" father""? we learned that the actor who played struggled to make ends meet because he died so early in Christof's script, this is certainly one of the reason, but whats the main reason that i didnt catch? from my understanding, after learning that his 'dad"" wasnt dead, his fear for the sea certainly went down, consequently leading to his attempt to escape from his village. Cchristof definitely doesnt want to see that.
3. we learned that Christof profits greatly through truman, and the show had always been a sensation, so Christof certainly want the show to continue. In other words, he wants Truman to be as clueless about everything as possible(?), but some of the things just cant convince me that he is trying his hardest to conceal the whole truth.

* the radio thing
* the horribly staged traffic jam
* the light in the sky
* his wife promoting merchandises
* the fake marriage photo
* him meeting the same people everyday, having the same exact conversation everyday

And good Lord, their ad is terrible.

At least AMC's Kidman ad carries a little weight and value. Sure, it takes itself too seriously, but otherwise it's written well enough, accurately sums up how I feel about going to the theater, and is only bearably annoying.

The Regal ad is none of these things. If you haven't seen it: [for the uninitiated.](https://youtu.be/WaO2EE43fY0?si=QPh1GtNR46Bcf9En)

It's a bunch of movie lines that any everyday moviegoer would recognize, smashed together to try and force nostalgia.

It's like the writers sent Regal the script and the only feedback was ""Triple the movie quotes but keep the runtime the same.""

I really wish Regal wasn't so damn convenient for me. If I went to a theater just for the pre roll ad, I would pick Nicole Kidman every time. She's really not bad at all compared to the alternative.

The NY Times called him the greatest actor of the 21st century in 2020. Here is my list of his top ten movie performances:

1. Training Day - Before this film, no one could really see Denzel in the role of a movie villain, much less a dirty gangster cop, but he owned this role.
2. Glory - As a former slave and a troubled but triumphant union soldier in the Civil War, Denzel brought a realness to this experience that put him on the map and won him his first oscar.
3. The Pelican Brief - He played a very smart and quick witted reporter opposite Julia Roberts uncovering a conspiracy behind the assassination of Supreme Court justices. Very intelligent film.
4. Malcolm X - He truly embodied the persona of one of the most historic and controversial civil rights leaders. Denzel truly became this role on screen.
5. Philadelphia - As an attorney representing Tom Hanks' character, he was brilliant in the first movie to really take on the stigma around the AIDS epidemic.
6. The Hurricane - Denzel gave a tremendous performance as a wrongly accused and imprisoned former boxer. A performance for which he was robbed of an oscar in favor of accused sexual predator Kevin Spacey.
7. Flight - Another dynamic performance; played an alcoholic hero pilot who saved the lives on his plane with a miracle landing.
8. Remember the Titans - Never an actor to dodge the complexities and uncomfortable history of racism in America, Denzel was at his best playing a trailblazing new high school coach in an extremely racially charged town and era.
9. Crimson Tide - One of my favorite all-time movies, Denzel was paired with another acting great and oscar winner Gene Hackman, the no. 2 commander on a nuclear submarine that almost sets off World War III.
10. American Gangster - Denzel impressively brought to life the story of a home grown self-made ganster who was brought down by the inevitable excesses of his lifestyle.

Lately I've been watching some movie classics. One of them was this one. Despite the good reviews, I didn't like the movie at all. Excellent actors and good performances, but the story is very bad. This is simply the story of a betrayal. A married woman with children and an apparently good life gets tired of the routine. The solution? To fuck the first stranger she comes across. Not only that, but her children end up approving of what happened. As soon as her husband dies, she goes after the other one.

I understand that the film is seen from her perspective, but I couldn't empathize with the story.

It was like watching a movie that tells the story of a crime from the killer's perspective.

People cried a lot watching this movie because of the story. The only thing I can cry about is that husband who asked her what she had when she was crying for the other dude.

Some parts are rushed through so much. >!Like how did she get so much money at the end. Did she do favors in return for money.!< It's not clear.

It‚Äôs entirely subjective, but most would agree that only a handful of actors have that unique talent.

A close-up shot of an actor‚Äôs face showing fear, sadness, desperation, or rage can create a sense of unease in the viewer. The audience can see the subtle changes in the actor‚Äôs expression, such as a widening of the eyes or a tensing of the jaw, that indicate the character‚Äôs present emotional state.

Similarly, a close-up shot of a character‚Äôs face showing joy can elicit a positive emotional response from the viewer. Either way, the quality of the viewing experience is elevated.

movies,t3_1d2c4bv,1716874595.0,/r/movies/comments/1d2c4bv/strangers_chapter_1_review_spoilers/,Discussion,Strangers chapter 1 review SPOILERS,"Background: I was lucky enough to see the original film many years ago in theaters. (The strangers 2008) I remember the anxiousness, fear and overall feeling of dread once the movie was over. Still you know something is good if it resonates with you. I love horror films by the way and I‚Äôve never really been into ghost or spooky films because I am one of those people that believe that reality is scary enough. I guess that‚Äôs the thing with the first film, the randomness of it all. 

Why I‚Äôm qualified to review this film: 
Couple of months back my gf asked to see the first movie (The strangers 2008) since she‚Äôs a big horror film lover herself and she‚Äôd never seen it. I begged her not to, not because I didn‚Äôt think it was awesome but I just remembered the feeling of dread it gave me. So of course we watched it, it was awesome I think as an adult now i appreciated it more. The pacing, the jump scares, the fact that the movie ended with the villains winning. She hated and loved it as well, she was glued to the screen and was truly scared. I remember her wanting to cleanse her pallet after watching the film because it was just that creepy to her. I think we watched South Park or some Disney plus show to get our minds of what we had just seen. I think I tried to make her watch Invincible but she hated it. Lost interest in less than a minute.

The review: Fast foward to today after a severe thunderstorm ruined our plans we agreed to see the ‚Äúprequel‚Äù to the movie that had once captivated us. I was excited as one of my friends had seen the film earlier and gave it a rave review. ‚ÄúIt was good bro 10/10‚Äù- my boy Miguel

The good:
* Nostalgia factor was in full effect, one of those haha I understand that reference moments, ie. when you see the little kids from the ending of the first film handing out Jesus flyers to the new protagonists. 
*The new couple is hot, guy and girl, Dean Winchester 2.0 and Madeline Petsch are eye candy. Especially her I can tell she never misses a leg day. 
*The end I guess what annoyed me in the first film is the fact that the protagonists never really get revenge. Everyone loves a good revenge story ( ie. Count of Monte Cristo, Kill Bill, Alladin) sequels set that up. There‚Äôs going to be a second film nd possibly a third I read.
*Maya is sort of smart, she calls 911, reminds Dean to get the shotgun and finds the crawlspace. She also hides in the bushes.

The bad:
My gf said the acting felt cheesy.
Characters make some dumbass mistakes.
One of my biggest gripes is that The strangers felt superhuman.The scariest part of The original strangers 2008 movie was that the antagonists were normal people who were just bored. These strangers move like ninjas lol
Second gripe MOTIVATION: The movie makes sure to show you how the townies hate the city people. The couple in the Diner might be the strangers in the movie, motivated by the fact that the couple aren‚Äôt married. The male stranger even hugs one of the girls which at first I thought was cool, but then I hated. In the original movie it was just a group of people who were nuts and wanted to hunt people, just because. Or they were in a cult, we will never know and I think that‚Äôs cool.

Quick Review: 7/10 

I liked it but it felt blah, I also think Madame Web was an ok movie so factor that in to my rating.

I remember that one of the main cast, (Hana, I believe) was in the film a lot and that there were some jokes made at her expense, but I can't remember if the movie portrayed her in a way that could be a negative or insensitive caricature of trans people. 

I remember I liked the film at the time, but I watched it at a time when I didn't know what a trans person was. I just remember thinking that Hana was a woman with weird facial expressions at times. I warned this friend about it, and they said they don't mind the occasional joke about trans people, so long as she wouldn't be totally antagonised or stoned by the end she won't care.

It was only until it released onto NETFLIX that I decided to watch it and didn‚Äôt think much of the film itself. The only things that really stocked with me was the visuals and the music, but still I felt the urge to learn more about this man.

I remember looking up the LSO performance of Mahler‚Äôs Symphony No. 2 at Ely Cathedral (the one that is portrayed on the film) and just being in awe of not only the grandiosity of the music but also the physicality of Bernstein and the emotion he emits. Some may see it as an ego and attention thing, but I believe it brings so much more value to the performance that it otherwise would have. It is one of the best performances of one of the best pieces of classical music ever.

This revitalised my love for classical music. I did like it before, but now I really was in love with it, and still now after listening to so much classical music I still think the ending of Mahler No. 2 is some of the greatest pieces of music in human history.

I come from Quebec City, most of the movies here are dubbed in French with local talent. Nowadays we mostly get every single new release in its original language, but it wasn‚Äôt always the case for me and growing up I had to sit through a lot of movies with a French dub if I wanted to see them in the theater.

Personally, I‚Äôll take subs over dubs any frickin‚Äô day of the week, no matter the language. I tend to fixate on the people‚Äôs lips not moving in sync with their dialogue and it kind of ruins the experience for me, but I have (mainly francophone) friends who have grown up with dubs of a certain movie and who actually prefer them to the original versions. A friend of mine cannot watch Titanic if its not the French version, because that‚Äôs the version he is nostalgic towards. 

However I will admit that there are a few cases where I can appreciate a dub; the Quebec dub of Slap Shot with Paul Newman is absolutely legendary for anyone in Quebec with a love of hockey. The Simpsons has been dubbed with multiple cultural references adapted to our local culture. I‚Äôll still take the originals over the dubs, but I can appreciate when an effort is made. 

Anyways, I was just curious. Has there ever been an experience where a dubbing of a film or series enhanced the experience for you or do you view it as detrimental to the work no matter the case?",19,0

[Nashville (1975)](https://www.criterion.com/films/28427-nashville) / Our Collection

IMDb Summary: Over the course of a few hectic days, numerous interrelated people prepare for a political convention.

Starring an ensemble cast including David Arkin, Barbara Baxley, Ned Beatty, Karen Black, Ronee Blakley, Timothy Brown, Keith Carradine, Geraldine Chaplin, Robert DoQui, Shelley Duvall, Allen Garfield, Henry Gibson, Scott Glenn, Jeff Goldblum, Barbara Harris, David Hayward, Michael Murphy, Allan F. Nicholls, Dave Peel, Cristina Raines, Bert Remsen, Lily Tomlin, Gwen Welles, and Keenan Wynn. 

I cannot say for sure that this was the first Robert Altman film I ever saw. Honestly, that was probably Popeye. But I do recall the first time we saw this film. At our first home here in Texas, in the bedroom.  I remember Zedd and I looking at each other like ‚Äúwhat the heck was that?‚Äù 

There is just *so much* going on in this film. My feel is that when you experience a Robert Altman film it is as if you have a direct link into his brain. I believe he hears it all, but what does he absorb? Bits. Bites. The important stuff? But what, my friends, is *important*? 

In this film, we have several intertwining stories of Nashville, on a special day. Barbara Jean is coming back to town. She‚Äôs been gone, recovering after an accidental fire (or perhaps a nervous breakdown?) There are some recording sessions going on, and a BBC reporter (she says) is running around getting a bunch of stories down on her trusty pocket recorder. 

All of this action surrounds a fundraiser for Hal Philip Walker, Replacement Party candidate in the 1976 United States presidential election. One of the most upsetting parts, though, was the storyline of Mr. Green, whose dying wife Esther has her niece Martha (aka ‚ÄúL.A. Joan"") come in to visit her in the hospital, though she ignores them in favor of every musician and adjacent person, until Esther passes away, leaving her devoted husband devastated. 

There are plenty of cameos of famous folks like Julie Christie (‚Äúdoes not know how to use a comb‚Äù), Elliott Gould, Sue Barton, Vassar Clements, and Howard K. Smith. 

In the end, something really awful happens, and in the weirdest turn of events, Winifred, an aspiring Country singer, who has been running away from her husband through the whole film, begins singing ""It Don't Worry Me"" in front of a stage of shell shocked people. 

I think that this could be looked at a few different ways. A cautionary tale, about politics, about guns, about the frailty of human life amid mental illness. 

But I read a little on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù this happened, and what pushed this person to do this horrible thing.  I never found a reason. What I did find, though, was that Winifred‚Äôs chosen song was not without thought. It was chosen carefully to show that through it all, people are strong and resilient, and we will survive. 

I try to keep that in mind during these trying times. We‚Äôll get through it. One day, one hour, hell, one minute at a time. Right?  

It don‚Äôt worry me, ***Movie On!***",5,5

It's such a beautiful film that my grandad used to play for me when I was about 6 years old. It brings back good feelings. It also is making me sad as I have a lack of romantic love with a man in my life. It's also reminding me how fast time passes - Olivia and Leonard are old now and have lived lives. That time of no phones is far gone. Films like this havent been made.

Anyway onto the film - in my opinion, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is the best film ever made. Here‚Äôs why:

Firstly, the film stays incredibly faithful to Shakespeare's original play. The screenplay preserves the poetic dialogue and the tragic essence that define the story, making it a true representation of the Bard's work. This fidelity to the source material is something I deeply appreciate.

The setting and production design are simply stunning. Filmed in the picturesque towns of Italy, the movie brings Verona to life with historical accuracy. The detailed and immersive production design perfectly captures the Renaissance era, making it easy to feel transported back in time.

The performances are outstanding, especially Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey as Romeo and Juliet. Their portrayals are passionate and convincing, capturing the youthful innocence and intense emotion of their characters. Olivia Hussey, in particular, delivers a performance as Juliet that is both vulnerable and strong, which left a lasting impression on me.

The emotional depth and romantic chemistry between Whiting and Hussey make their love story believable and deeply affecting. The film excels in conveying the intensity of first love and the tragedy of the lovers' plight, which evoked a strong emotional response from me.

Zeffirelli's direction is innovative and accessible. His use of dynamic camera work and naturalistic performances keeps the story engaging for contemporary viewers. The cinematography beautifully captures the drama and romance of the narrative, with many memorable scenes that have become iconic in film history.

Lastly, the cultural impact and legacy of this film are undeniable. It popularized Shakespeare among younger audiences and influenced many subsequent adaptations. Its success demonstrates the timeless appeal of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and solidifies its place as a definitive cinematic version of the play.

Overall, Franco Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" stands out as the best film adaptation to me due to its faithful representation of Shakespeare‚Äôs work, stunning production design, powerful performances, and enduring impact on cinema and popular culture - don't forget the amazing costumes.",6,0

For context, the way I watched movies changed around 2017, and the last film to make my all time favourites list is La La Land.

I just finished listening to the phenomenal ""The Rest is History"" podcast series about Custer, Crazy Horse, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn. I would love to see Alejandro I√±√°rritu transform this epic tale into a four-hour masterpiece, akin to the visceral opening battle in ""The Revenant."" The narrative could trace the extraordinary lives of both Crazy Horse (known as Curly Hair in his youth) and General Custer, each leading lives marked by fierce battles and profound connections to the land. Their journeys, filled with complexities and moral ambiguities, ultimately converge in one of the bloodiest confrontations of the American West. The lives of these iconic figures are far from black and white, and I√±√°rritu's vision could bring this nuanced story to the screen with breathtaking intensity.

I was thinking about this as I was thinking of Marvel's MCU: they don't really have trilogies of their movies, as their characters have arcs that spread throughout numerous films. So much as we can talk about the Iron Man or Captain America trilogies on their stories, their stories are not 3 films but 7-8 movies with their solo films being part of the narrative. It'd be one thing if they could be watched by themselves, but you can't as you need the other films. 

Same goes for the Kelvin Star Trek Trilogy; 3 movies, but I never got the sense that it was suppose to be that, but with more films that sadly haven't been made. Same goes for the Snyderverse Trilogy as that was never suppose to be, with 1-2 more films finishing the story, but became one in the end.

Of course, Star Trek has a trilogy with II, III, and IV; 3 films interconnected from the themes, and how one leads toward the other, and can't exist without. Star Wars has three trilogies, there's Lord of the Rings, of course; Matrix, and even The Dark Knight Trilogy. These movies are true trilogies because they connect together with their stories, not like the others. But in the end, is it 3 films in a set or 3 part stories that make it a true trilogy?",14,0

And similarly in The Batman, but sticks out even more so because the rest of the film is so serious, is when Battinson throws himself off the police building to do a wing suit.

I think it is a black and white gangster flick where the mob leader would grind his espresso cup into its saucer. I seem to recall that was significant as it was a signal to his cronies to what someone.

Which means it cost more than the first Transformers(145), Iron Man(150), War of the Worlds(135), Hellboy 2(80), Star Trek(150). Where did that 175 million go?","Look at the list of films next to X-Men Origins. These are all big, VFX heavy action oriented films. Transformers has giant fucking Robots fighting and blowing up cities. Showing off pricey military equipment. Huge cast. 

War of the Worlds had Tom Cruise & Spielberg. Aliens! John Williams! ILM effects. Oh my!

Iron Man had the suit, the effects, the sets, the cast. Shot in LA!

Meanwhile X-Men Origins filmed in Australia, and cost 175 million! I‚Äôve seen some places say it was a bit more, some say less. I‚Äôve never seen a figure below 150 million. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter. The movie doesn‚Äôt look like it cost more than 40. The effects are AWFUL. There‚Äôs a shot of an Asian guy running onto a helicopter from a hill that‚Ä¶shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near a film of this scale. It looks like a straight to DVD film at times. It really does. Worse. It looks like a cheap TV show.

Then there‚Äôs the bathroom scene. You know the one. Logan marvels at his CGI claws and rubs them together and they look, well, ugh.

I know there‚Äôs a million different things that can play into a films budget. But Jesus. This is something else entirely. Was someone siphoning off money for some nefarious means? 

Just look at the movie! The movie doesn‚Äôt have particularly good sets, the director is a B list journeyman, the only big name is Hugh. We are suppose to be in Africa at one point. The village looks hilariously bland. Or look at the bar Logan finds Victor in. Some wood planks. 175 million for some sets made of wood planks 

I don‚Äôt see any A List crew members. The cinematography is meh-poor. The score is mostly garbage. The editing is choppy. The VFX look unfinished. 

Let‚Äôs say a lot of money went to reshoots. That still doesn‚Äôt explain how this movie cost over anywhere over even 90 forget 175 million dollars! 

Look at what Guillermo Del Toro did with 80 million on HellBoy 2! Big action, great sets, great make up, amazing costumes, VFX, animatronics, great cinematography. Danny Elfman did the score and he doesn‚Äôt come cheap. 

X men Origins Wolverine had‚Ä¶the guy from the Black Eyed Peas? Merry from Lord of the Rings. Ryan Reynolds wasn‚Äôt a big star at this point. The guy who played Victor wasn‚Äôt a star. Taylor Kitsch had done that football show. 

If you‚Äôre a producer on this movie and see what Michael Bay was getting for 145 million Vs what you got for MORE money, how do you not feel like a failure?",41,0

**LOOKING FOR**  
- EROTIC, EXPERIMENTAL, SHORT FILMs; twisted, bizarre, weird, dark, cult, ritual, satanic, preferably DARK scenes if possible with highly colored lighting. Trashy, but not cheesy.

**NOT LOOKING FOR**  
- I'm not looking for any kind of hardcore, softcore porn, or scenes with sexual penetration, unless it's tasteful, artistic, bizarre, etc. As long as it's not cheesy. An example of a movie with sexual penetration and pornographic scenes, but done in a tasteful, artistic and creative way without any cheese: **Bacchanale (1970)**  
- No blood and gore.

**EXAMPLES OF WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR**

***Dyn Amo 1972*** - A woman slowly strips naked, but as she stares into the camera, she slowly reveals how empty and sad her soul is.

**A MAL GAM A** 1976 Directed by Iv√°n Zulueta - Scene where a scantily clad woman smokes while being visually sexually objectified by a man.

***Film About a Woman Who‚Ä¶ 1974*** - A man slowly undresses a woman, then slowly redresses her. He does so in the slowest manner possible. It's just so weird, something I've never seen before.

***L‚Äôart d‚Äôaimer 1985*** - An older, average looking woman, who isn't afraid to wear sexually provocative night time lingerie, stares into the camera while smoking a cigarette, in dark intimate lighting. Finally when she goes to bed, she looks into the camera, revealing the state of her soul.

**Casual Relations 1974** - A slender, tone woman without makeup looks into the camera, wearing only a choker and short stockings, smoking a cigarette. She strikes various poses and tells a story through her eyes. Finally, she masturbates towards the end.

**Sinthia The Devils Doll 1970 -** Lesbian vampires dancing in the nude and performing some kind of ritual magic to bewitch others.

**Spare Bedroom (1970) Frans Zwartjes -** An experimental look at the sexual life of a¬†couple

**Christabel James Fotopoulos 2001**

I'm not saying he's a bad actor.

Would you place him alongside Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt or Leo Di Caprio? These actors are also known for their looks, of course, but they also have a number of iconic films, so their popularity can be ‚Äújustified‚Äù.

Mad Max vs Alien vs Halloween vs ???,"Some of my absolute favorite franchises (for better or worse) prioritize FUN over lore, even when lore is supposed to be part of the fun. Nothing cuts me so deep as the latest Legend of Zelda game suddenly 'rebooting' the franchise out of nowhere, retconning an already shaky continuity older fans like me have become obsessed with.

And with ""Furiosa"" coming out soon, it's a great reminder that Mad Max, a huge sci-fi franchise, has absolutely no respect for the passage of time lol. We see the title character as a police officer in what's basically pre-apocalypse Australia, but somehow before he gets gray hair there's already a race of albino mutants with their own religion in Fury Road? And Furiosa is set decades before Fury Road... so before Mad Max 1 but still post-apocalypse. Absolute nonsense. *FUN* nonsense, but damn lol.

The same is unfortunately true with the Alien franchise. I love all the movies and the explicit and implicit lore building is AWESOME! Until they just say ""details are stupid"" and retcon some settings and timelines. It's not quite so noticeable unless you're a huge nerd, but I feel like whether you're there for the lore or the HR Giger monsters you're likely pretty nerdy.

But WOOF -- the worst offender by far in my opinion is Halloween. How many times has Laurie died? There are like 4 distinct timelines, minimum, with very little distinction between them in the naming conventions.

These types of fun movies have to be extremely self aware about how unserious they are, and heavily rely on awkward and quirky dialogue to create humor. A very recent example I can think of is Fall Guy, I know I am in the minority but I think its first hour is absolutely atrocious in terms of dragging each comedic scene too long and just being a bore. It picks itself a little bit back up near the end and looks a tad bit more like what I was expecting. Then you have your whole swathes of Dial of Destinies, Frozen Empire, Bullet Train, Lost City, Jurrasic World. While I don't think a lot of them are absolutely horrible, but most of them are at best mediocre, which imo is worse than being straight up bad (as we can just come together and laugh at how bad something is, for me which is Rebel moon). 

While there are still plenty of amazing movies that are award contenders, small festival indie movies, great international drama's. I think there is a bit of a dead space in terms of just simply good turn off your brain movies. Biggest + in terms of the last couple of years would be imo DND, Top Gun Maverick, Furiosa, John Wick. 

So what would be the best decade for turn off your brain movies? I think for me its a toss up between the 90's and 2000-2010. 90s have the biggest selection of action movies, romance, and comedies that aren't necessarily the greatest movies ever, but are a cracking good time for the two hours you are watching it. 2000's for me is peak quality high school movie central.

I still think there are some terrific comedic performances from all of the cast, particularly an energetic Ray Liotta (in retrospect, I wish he'd done more comedy).

That being said, I wonder if the last few scenes have not aged as well as I thought.

For those unfamiliar, here's a bit of context:

>!Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt are mother and daughter con artists Max and Paige.  Max finds a wealthy man, whom she charms into marrying.  Paige then seduces him into cheating, only to be ""caught"" by Max, who then cleans him out in the divorce.!<

>!After running the scam on shady wiseguy Dean (Liotta), the pair travel to Palm Beach, where Max sets her sights on conning a chain-smoking tobacco mogul (Gene Hackman), but things are complicated when Paige plans a con of her own against a friendly young bar owner named Jack (Jason Lee), while Dean shows up, determined to win his ex-wife ""Angela"" back.!<

>!Paige develops feelings for Jack and decides to call it off, but Max's would be mark coughs himself to death, and Dean discovers who they really are, they're forced to resume the con against Jack.!<

>!Although Jack rebuffs Max, Paige catches them in bed together, though it's later revealed that Max ""micked"" him, which appalls even Dean.!<

>!After Max comes clean, Paige gives back the bar that Jack lost in the split, and seemingly reveals the truth, leaving Jack's reaction up to the imagination.!<

When I was younger, I just took for granted that Paige and Jack lived happily ever after, but in retrospect, they probably shouldn't have.  Not only is their entire relationship based on lies, but Jack is very much the victim of robbery and assault.  It's especially ironic that the latter half of the film asks the question of whether or not *he* can be trusted.

Had the roles been reversed, even back then, I doubt a comedy about male con artists drugging a woman would've been as overlooked by audiences.

I'm also reminded of a commentary where either the writer or director (I forget which) of ""Cruel Intentions"" said that the only way to redeem Ryan Phillipe's character was to have him die saving Reese Witherspoon's character.

It's a pity when movie from your youth maybe doesn't hold up on some issues.

For those who are unfamiliar with the term. Chekhov‚Äôs Gun: A narrative principle where an element introduced into a story first seems unimportant but will later take on great significance. Usually it‚Äôs an object or person, but it can also be an idea or concept.

A classic and well known example that I like:

The Winchester Rifle in Shaun of the Dead. It‚Äôs a literal gun talked about pretty early on and it‚Äôs used at the end of the movie during the climax to fend off zombies.

It can also be a more subtle character detail:

In Mad Max Fury Road, the Warboy Nux mentions that Max has type O blood, which means he‚Äôs a universal donor. At the end of the film, he saves Furiosas life by giving blood. 

What are some other uses of Chekhov‚Äôs Gun, whether subtle or bold?

[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) / Our Collection

IMDb Summary: British agent James Bond goes undercover to pursue the villainous Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who is planning to hold the world to ransom.

Starring George Lazenby, Diana Rigg, and Telly Savalas, Gabriele Ferzetti, Ilse Steppat, Bernard Lee, and Lois Maxwell. 

Folks, we have had a change in Bonds. While the script was going to address this with a plastic surgery plot addition, they instead decided not to address it at all except for some ‚Äúin-jokes‚Äù and statements like  ""This never happened to the other fellow‚Ä¶‚Äù Honestly, though, it was not funny as George Lazenby, though a handsome enough and well-built fellow, had none of the charisma of Sean Connery. Many of the quips fell flat and as much as it was poor acting, it also felt like poor directing, as there was not enough time after the delivery of the lines before the scenes changed. 

New director Peter R. Hunt is on the job and ready to roll! On previous films, he worked as an editor and then as a second unit director. He developed a way of editing utilizing quick cutting, allowing camera swings which set him apart and he was told he would be able to direct *You Only Live Twice*(1967) but was passed over. He quit, but came back with promises to direct the *next* film. He said he wanted to make it different, **his** Bond film. He was asked to direct quite a few others, but declined every time. 

The film has some exquisite cuts, this is a truth. It also has some spectacular scenery. The contrast of the colors with the blue sky and white snow is nearly blinding. Zedd noted. Unfortunately, at several points during the action scenes especially, (filmed by the second unit) the quality of the film goes from clear to muddy and back. A rather striking lack of consistency which really should not have made it through the quality checks. 

Dame Rigg is absolutely gorgeous.  I especially noticed her costuming, done by Marjory Cornelius, which is spoken of in the what now seems to be the defunct [Clothes On Film](https://www.imdb.com/news/ni12067471/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) and spoken of [here as well.](https://alicequinn.tumblr.com/post/183121624724/best-of-james-bond-costuming-diana-rigg-as-tracy) 

The story was really quite good, with Bond being bested not by an enemy, but by love. Bond remains single for a reason. As much as Tracy was his match, his life has never been one of settling down and having six babies.  But the poor acting and movie length really dragged it down for both of us. The final ski chase went on for what felt like an hour, but which was really not *that* long, I did not need 20 minutes of it. 

We‚Äôve had one Bond change-out, but not the last. I always like Sean Connery the best, but you ***Movie On*** your way! ",31,3

movies,t3_1d18v98,1716751134.0,/r/movies/comments/1d18v98/caesars_planet_of_the_apes_trilogy_isnt_just/,Discussion,"Caesar's Planet of the Apes trilogy isn't just unique for its consistent quality, but for its world and characters","You've heard it before; everyone who has good taste in movies loves the Caesar Apes trilogy. They're fantastic, especially the latter two, which are some of the most compelling and viscerally satisfying films I've ever seen. The score rules, the direction is confident, and the performances, CGI, and effects are all uniformly outstanding. And Rise, even with its flaws and tonal differences compared to Dawn/War, is still a damn fine movie. We all know this.

  
What I don't see talked about as often is how, especially among other blockbuster type films, its central characters and the way it progresses its worldbuilding/story is relatively unique.



Characters - In what other film series is the central cast entirely non-human? I've thought about this before, and I feel like it's relatively rare. And I'm not just referring to stuff like X-Men, where they're 'mutants-but-still-basically-human-except-for-their-powers-etc', or films where it's essentially split between non-humans and humans such as Star Trek/Wars or District 9, kids films like Homeward Bound or Beethoven etc, or when the characters aren't explicitly human but still largely exhibit human behavior like Zootopia, Inside Out, or Toy Story. There are specific examples that possibly do kinda fit this mold, like The Lion King, A Bug's Life, 9, Nightmare Before Christmas or The Dark Crystal, maybe. But none of these quite hit the balance that the apes in the Caesar trilogy do, where they're very clearly \*animals\*, but also develop human traits throughout the story, and their central conflict is against humans themselves. 

That's another difference, in that the cast gets multiple films to develop; a lot of examples with explicitly non-human characters listed have only one title to them and don't get as much room to expand on their characters' stories, and especially don't explore what it's like to \*be\* an Other in their own world over a full series \[except maybe... Toy Story? I guess? Arguably.\]

  
The World - This, combined with the last point, is what I think makes the Caesar Trilogy so interesting. When we start in Rise, the world is normal, analogous to our own. Then through the course of the series, the world drastically changes and the dynamic shifts completely. I can't think of any other series to pull that off in the same way over multiple films. Plenty of films are one-offs where the prologue is normality and the main story is post-disaster, or taking place fully in the apocalyptic aftermath, or are disaster films where the devolution of the planet over the course of the film is the point of the story \[sidenote: this is what makes me really interested in the sequel to Greenland, which was already a really good large-scale disaster movie and I wanna see what a continuation to that would look like\]. Though to be fair, in the trilogy, I guess Rise is basically the 'normality prologue', with the latter two being the meat of the story in the actual post-apocalypse. But it works incredibly well, and isn't something we see take place over multiple films. That I know of, at least. \*Maybe\* Mad Max could arguably show the devolution of the world throughout the course of multiple films, but I'd chock that up more to budgetary limitations than actual story intent.

  
That's my long ramble about what I think makes Caesar's Ape Trilogy impactful and interesting. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the matter, and to point out any movies or TV series I missed that may follow a similar arc.

  
Also, sidenote, I have not seen Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes yet. But I'm pretty certain based on what I've heard it doesn't tie into the Caesar Trilogy's arc, and so doesn't really fit into discussion of it. Please no spoilers!",33,88

I saw this when it was released. At the time it just didn't click with me at all. I knew nothing about the video games. I wanted to see it because I was a big fan of the director Christophe Gans especially his film *Brotherhood of the Wolf*.  I also loved Roger Avary's *Rules of Attraction*.

I think part of the reason is I'm not the biggest fan of the ""doomed protagonist"". Watching it now almost 20 years later & thar didn't bother me at all. Rose is tough & persistent but she's in a walking nightmare & really struggles every moment like anyone would whose in her place.

I appreciated that so much more this time. She's willing to do whatever it takes to find her daughter. That doesn't make what she's going through any less horrifying & she ""succeeds"" in a large part due to luck. 

I'd also forgotten how great the film looks. It's a $50 million movie & every bit of it is on the screen. There's fantastic practical & digital effects. The production design is impeccable & really highlights the decay & adds to the atmosphere. 

Dan Laustsen is the director of photography. He's a frequent collaborater with Guillermo del Toro. He also did *Nightwatch* (1994) & the American remake which I liked quite a bit. The shots of Rose just walking the abandoned streets create such a feeling of unease.

I'm really glad that I decided to watch this again. I'm also excited for Gans new adaptation coming up. For anybody curious about this it's available for streaming with Netflix & rental through the usual online retailers. I highly recommend it.",127,590

When ‚ÄúDistrict 9‚Äù dropped in 2009, I thought Neill Blomkamp was going to be the SHIT of the sci-fi/horror genre. Aliens, body horror, the semi-retrofuturistic tech aesthetic, and some social commentary to top it all off.

WT actual F happened

‚ÄúGran Turismo‚Äù: Guess we're making ads for video games now, huh

I'd lost hope. Sci-fi horror is already a niche genre, and barring some trickles like ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù, it was almost non-existant.

Then comes 2021, and news of ‚ÄúPossessor‚Äù pops up, and it's David Cronenberg's son. The trailers look amazing, and oh you know what, he's made a film about ten years ago called ‚ÄúAntiviral‚Äù. Guess I'll give it a watch.

And it's wonderful. And guess what, ‚ÄòPossessor's quite wonderful too. That itch that's been there for 13 years? Scratched over contentedness, nails raking up skin to reach the flesh underneath. And he isn't done. ‚ÄúInfinity Pool‚Äù was kind of whatever but it was filmed before ‚ÄúPossessor‚Äù so you know he hasn't lost his touch. Plus everyone but me seems to love it so that can't hurt.

When they are doing the reenactment,  Daniel mentions that his dad helped him get around using different textured tape for different locations. 

At one point he is going out the door and it touching the tape for a few seconds, and then claims that he was confused and misremembered. 

The impression I got from that scene was that the tape was different from the day his dad died, or there was something amiss with it. 

I don't actually know what the point would have been, because he seems able to see well enough now and knows the outlay of the house to not get lost anymore. But I thought maybe the tape being different was going to end up being a clue to either the dad purposefully trying to confuse his son, or his mom covering things up and also trying to cause confusion. 

I searched around but couldn't find any other discussions about this. Did any one else get the same feel from this scene, or am I just imagining implications that are not actually there?",9,7

I have a few things to say about the Stepford Wives 2004 remake. If you don't know what it's about basically in a community called Stepford the husbands have gotten together and turned their incredibly successful wives into submissive robots quite literally. A new family moves there after having marital issues and while the wife is trying to become more like the other loving wives who she doesn't know are robots her husband is persuaded by the other men to transform her.

Now for the critique. For starters, the writing was done lazily. This is because they could not decide whether or not the women were actually replaced by robots or if they were themselves but with mind-altering chips. Throughout the movie it shows us that the women are actual robots. We see a woman's boobs grow at the press of a remote, a woman starts malfunctioning and sparking, a robot version of the main character and a robot version of a side character yet despite all that it's just chips implanted in their brains and when the chips are destroyed everyone is in their original bodies. It makes no sense and I feel like the movie just didn't want to explain where the bodies were or something. Personally, I think the chip idea is a better one for this movie than robot duplicates. Of course, if it did that we wouldn't get to see a woman's tits grow with a push of a button or see one dispense $20 from her mouth to pay what her husband owes.

We also see in the movie that when the main character Joanne is asking about the lady who started freaking out and sparking she keeps showing concern for the lady and her husband says it's not about her and that he wants a divorce because he thinks she's a mean person to generally everyone and she undermines him when we aren't shown any of that. He's saying she's cold to people when she's genuinely concerned about a neighbor's health and it's odd that's the last straw for him. It just did not fit.

One critique I've heard about it I don't necessarily agree with is that the movie is anti-feminist. I think it is feminist but doesn't know how to do that properly, especially when mixing it with comedy. One reason I saw as to why it wasn't feminist was because the main villain was a woman and the person who saved the day was a man. I get what they were getting at but disagree. Joanne and her husband saved the day not just her husband and a woman being a villain doesn't mean its an anti-feminist movie. You can show in a feminist film a happy couple who needs each other and works together as well as showing women can be wrong and can go against other women. I do think the motive the movie gave the villain for being a villain is poor.

She got cheated by her husband with her younger blonde assistant, of course, and she kills them and tries to make the world her fantasy. A world where men are gentlemen and women are treated nicely. This makes no sense because she has the ability to control men but chooses not to for the most part. She says that controlling men was the next step but she did control a feminine gay guy so it all makes no sense. Plus the guys weren't being nice to their wives so it would be better to go couple by couple instead of doing all women and then men. I get that she's crazy but it would make more sense if her reasoning is just that she's sexist and thinks women should be submissive instead of saying she had a fantasy. It would have hit harder too because there are real women think like that. The background story of the villain was plain ridiculous. Of course, it is still feminist because the whole point of the movie is that women are not objects and men shouldn't be threatened by their successful wives. Let's get onto the men though.

So these men are the ones choosing to get their wives the brainchips. When all the chips are shut off we see that all the women are angry so none of them wanted this to happen to them. Basically, they were enslaved. We know that these men are having sex with their wives in a state they cannot give consent. You already know what that implies. Instead of the film telling or showing us the women leave their partners and the men are held accountable for their actions, it tells us all the husbands are still with their wives. Their punishment is they have to do shopping quietly. I'm sure the men also have to do the chores but that is the bare minimum punishment. These men have done revolting things and this feminist film does not punish them.

Also, we are supposed to root for Bobby as a strong hardworking woman but I think she's bad too. Her and her husband are so stubborn they both choose not to clean up the house despite them having three kids. Plus she breaks into places all the time. I get what her character's supposed to do but being a feminist is not about refusing to do chores, it's about being treated equally and not a possession. That's what the whole film is about and they missed it.

Lastly, the film wants to be a comedy sci-fi horror and messed up each one of these. It couldn't decide on robots or brain chips so it already ruined the sci-fi thing and it was seldomly scary because it didn't take anything seriously due to being a comedy. It could have been a lot more scary or thrilling. It also didn't make me laugh, but I usually don't at movies.

All in all not really a bad movie just mediocre. I do think it's more of a fetish thing than a film meant to break society like the first one was. If you want to see pretty robot women then this is a good film. Don't expect to see the world differently though.",19,2

The latest victim being Furiosa. 

Some big changes are needed and here are some of my thoughts:

1. Cut the budgets. Movies don't need a $300 million budget to be enjoyable. Get creative.

2. Shorten run times. We all have shorter attention spans now. Personally the only way I can sit through a whole movie without getting distracted is when I am at the cinema. Shorter movie should also equate to smaller budget right? 

3. Actor salary cuts. Big name actors aren't enough of a draw card anymore. This will help with reducing the overall budget. Musicians had to adapt with a change in earnings and generate income through other means.

Not only did he have the build, the height, the eyes, the voice, and the look of Bruce Wayne, he had a great chin. 

I found out later that Tim Burton probably did screen test him, and felt that Keaton was a better fit. Actors tend to be pretty tight lipped about roles they didn‚Äôt get, to not undermine the people that got it, but for years I thought it was a mistake. I remember people talking about a mass letter campaign to keep Keaton from portraying Batman, seeing him as an undersized comedic actor, but I think we can all agree he nailed it.

The other issue I had was that Danny Elfman wasn‚Äôt the voice of Jack Skellington in the Nightmare Before Christmas. He does all the singing, wrote all the music, and has a great voice. It felt like such a missed opportunity. Then I found out that he did, in fact, record his voice for the entire film. It was felt that he just wasn‚Äôt a strong voice actor, which he isn‚Äôt, and the bad guy from Princess Bride came in to replace him. I think Danny Elfman is still a bit bummed about it.

Bruce Willis was also excellent in the movie, and deserved more award recognition.

So I'm not against those and appreciate them. But what about more realistic horror?

When you go for realism, it becomes more difficult to scare people, understandably, so I've seen filmmakers rely on cheap camera tricks (i.e. too many jump scenes) instead.

So what about realistic movies that terrify you and also don't rely on cheap tricks? So for instance if the mother is a psychotic person who tortures and kills her kids, you think she could really exist in real life and act just like that.

Examples below include:  
  
  
ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA 1984 ‚Äì Sergio Leone considered the film a nostalgic look at early gangster films, specifically ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, THE ROARING TWENTIES, LITTLE CAESAR, BULLETS OR BALLOTS and HIGH SIERRA.  
  
TRANSFORMERS 2007 ‚Äì The film was pitched as a cross between THE SEVEN SAMURAI and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND.  
  
KUNG FU PANDA 2008 ‚Äì The filmmakers cite the martial arts films CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, HERO, THE HOUSE OF FLYING DAGGERS and KUNG FU HUSTLE as an influence on the film.  
  
THE WOLVERINE 2013 ‚Äì James Mangold has called the film a mix of samurai films, Westerns, film noir and drama films.  
  
WONDER WOMAN 2017 - Patty Jenkins cites THE LITTLE MERMAID, SUPERMAN 78, BATMAN BEGINS, CASABLANCA and INDIANA JONES as an influence on the film.   
  
DUNE 2021 ‚Äì Denis Villeneuve cites the visual style of the film to be influenced by Brazilian modernist architecture, basic bunker buildings, temples and churches.   
  
Animated Filmmaker Satoshi Kon has said he was inspired by MONTY PYTHON, Akira Kurosawa films and sci-fi writer Philip K Dick.   
  
Tom Hiddleston says his performance of Loki has shades of Jack Nicholson, Peter O‚ÄôToole and Clint Eastwood.  
  
Filmmaker Wong kar-wai generally keeps quiet about what influences his work, but he has mentioned 80-90s MTV and his mentor Patrick Tam.  
  
¬†  
  
I believe it‚Äôs fascinating to learn what works artists use to bring out the best of their own talent. (Whether they are being truthful or serious about it is debatable)  
  
On the other hand, it‚Äôs risky for an artist to discuss sources of inspiration, because there would be inevitable comparisons made between the artist‚Äôs work and the source, and there‚Äôd be claims of lack of originality, even if both works are distinct.   
  
I personally feel that the more influences on a work, the less comparisons can be made. Practically, if a work has only one influence, it will be called a copy, while more influences lessen that impression. And creatively, you can compare it to different colors/shades of colors coming together to make a work of art.

Now, part of this might be because apes are cool, but also it was so much easier to get invested in the CGI creature that speaks a total of four words than any of his human counterparts.

A big part of the problem is that almost everyone comes off as one-dimensional. The boss is cartoonishly greedy in the way he constantly brings up how they could make money. Malfoy is cartoonishly dickish in everything he does, to the point that it drives his every action even when it doesn't otherwise make sense. Franco's girlfriend is pretty much a nothing character and his neighbor is just always framed as an asshole (despite being completely justified). In order for the plot to work, it relies on these simplistic behaviors mixed with pretty much everyone making really stupid decisions. 

The very beginning of the movie starts off on a bad foot by introducing us to the worst-run laboratory in the world. Despite regularly working with chimpanzees (an animal famously known for its aggressive behavior), they seem to have 0 security precautions when dealing with them. They remove them from enclosures by letting them free and just hoping to catch them, and then there's basically one unguarded door between them and total freedom. Not only that, but in the process of doing clinical drug trials, they apparently never collected enough bioinformatics to realize one of the subjects was pregnant. Later on, no one bats an eye, thinks to quarantine, or even run tests when an employee is exposed to an aerosolized virus.

-- 

Summer did not believe in love and fairytales and called them a ""fantasy"". Perhaps because she grew up in a broken home and never fell in love herself. 

Tom on the other hand loved and believed in all that: true love, fate, destiny, fairytales, the one... perhaps to a fault. 

LATER 

Towards the end of the film, Summer and Tom go to the cinema and Summer sobs as the movie ends, clearly because she was touched by the film. The scene she was crying in was a couple getting married. It had touched her. 

Later in the interview scene after the break up, the narrator unconvincingly says: ""If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can‚Äôt ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence. That‚Äôs all anything ever is. Nothing more than coincidence""

The narrator is Tom's inner dialogue, who's speaking from a place of heartbreak because Summer, the love of his life, shattered his illusion.... Within seconds he finds out the name of his potential new romance: Autumn. I used chat gpt to check out the maths and saw that the probability of dating someone called Summer followed by Autumn is 0.00205%

On hand it does show that Tom may have not learned anything, but on the other, it suggests that sometimes, at the right time, some things happen for a reason and not purely by co-incidence, and that love and unexplainable wonderful and humorous things can happen.

  
Since the disintegration of herAt the start of the movie, Summer would have called it dumb luck, given the fact that she did not believe in love because she had likely never been in love before... Till she married a man she met at a coffee shop who asked her about a book she was reading Dorian Gray, which parallels Tom's idealisation of her. 

The narrator at the start states that Summer only loved two things ""her long hair"" and ""how easily she could cut it off... And feel nothing""

At the beginning of the movie Summer has short hair. By the end, she has long hair. This symbolises her emotions and how she is able to feel again, in a way she never could with Tom. 

Summer got her happy ending and owes it Tom, for influencing her stance on love. The ending is open to interoperation but given the probability of meeting someone called Autumn, right after dating someone called Autumn is too co-incidental. 

It was a love story, to quote Autumn, ""You weren't looking""

I think a very small but notable reason is that there isn‚Äôt a well known/popular tastemaker critic around these days. We don‚Äôt have an Ebert, Siskel, Shalit, etc to encourage people to go to less sure things. We had some popular YouTubers like Stuckmann and Jahns but their reviews have gone down in quantity and it seems like YouTube is trending more towards essay style videos instead of reviewing everything. We have Rotten Tomatoes and that seems to have sway but that‚Äôs an entity not a personality. 

I also think criticism has gotten progressively more clickbaity. Saying something is pretty good doesn‚Äôt drive nearly as much engagement as saying something sucks or is amazing or is under/overrated. I personally am seeing less titles saying ‚ÄúMovie (2024) review‚Äù and more ‚ÄúMovie (2024) IS A CATASTROPHIC DUMPSTER FIRE!‚Äù Personally, it turns me off of looking for reviews in general so I might have missed some gems because I‚Äôm not looking for recommendations. 

But I do think we are getting more diversity and more voices in general for criticism which is a good thing. I don‚Äôt think Everything Everywhere would have done nearly as well without the many online recommendations in its corner. Everyone can be a reviewer so it‚Äôs easier than ever to find someone who matches your taste, but you might have to wade through some swamp to get there. What do you think? Has film criticism gotten better? Worse? Just different? Or is it pretty much the same? And if it‚Äôs different has it affected your choices in what you go to the theater to see?",49,0

I know I'm in the minority with this, but I really wasn't impressed with Dial of Destiny. I just found it to be incredibly bland and forgettable with a few very bad decisions. For better or for worse, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is at least super memorable due to the big swings it takes and fresh new ideas it explores in the franchise. That's always a movie I've felt got way too much hate even before 5 came out. While Kingdom was a step down from the trilogy, it has great action sequences, good new characters blended with the old, a cool macguffin, Harrison Ford is still giving it his all, the connection of the 1950's with Russians and Aliens is brilliant, it gives Indy a happy and proper ending, and best of all, it still has the Spielberg magic which made the first four great. Some bad CGI and a few stupid moments aren't enough to ruin that movie for me.

Dial of Destiny on the other hand.... had some fine action scenes, a cool reveal in the third act, good CGI, and a totally servicable plot. That being said though, I didn't care for any of the side characters, the villain was the most forgettable in the series by a long shot, Indy does nothing in the movie, Ford is phoning it in, Helena was insufferable, they end up doing nothing with the third act reveal, the story dragged and then suddenly rushed towards the end, and there didn't feel like there were any stakes. Worst of all, Indy being belittled constantly and being made to be a lonely, washed up, failed old man was just awful. Sure you can argue that's supposed to be the start of his arc, but he doesn't even do anything in the rest of the movie. He's basically forced on the mission with his goddaughter and some random kid who treat him bad. Also I need to mention that very few of the old characters returning from the previous 4 (except for cameos) was a missed opportunity. And the ending of having him reunite with Marion was their attempt at making a ""happy ending"" for him, but he already got that at the end of 4. Only in that movie, he was surrounded by friends, loved ones, had a good stable career, wasn't soon to be arrested, and had his son. Why did they kill off Mutt by the way, why not just recast him? That character from 4 would NEVER join the war either. And as I mentioned, the Spielberg magic was completely missing from here. Everyone loves to praise the opening sequence in Dial, but to me, it just felt like a cheap attempt to imitate a better director and a better set of movies that we already got decades ago.

i guess life is like that too, you know when they understand that they wont see each other again i guess (i mean i would‚Äôve) they got this feeling that you know when you seek for the purpose/meaning of life and you see nothing. When they realize that they wont see each other again like that connection became non-valuable what i mean by non-valuable is not to be misunderstood. (this is the wrong parameter in the metaphor tho) Of course it is a valuable because they will remember it but still they still didn't get to meet each other again so what is the meaning of it, human asks. I guess the purpose is memory. But lets keep out the memory thing out of context. (We still dont know what Jesse think about it tho maybe he didnt think about the memory thing at all) Then you can see that according to Jesse life doesn't have to have a meaning. Why did Jesse still want to live the moment or continue talking with her etc. Because it is just one night, just one chance so does your life. Maybe the writer never think about that idk or maybe his intention was exactly this idk i just i felt that way and made the connection in my head.

Both movies are about a tribe of apes being attacked by a more technologically advanced group. The hero's people are taken captive and forced to work by a megalomaniacal authoritarian leader. 

The hero goes on a quest to rescue them. In War the quest doesn't start out that way but turns into it. Along the way they find a human girl who tags along and another ape not part of the hero's tribe.

The hero ends up among the captive people of his tribe, has a meeting with the enemy leader.

Both movies end with a flood, one of water and the other of snow, and the heroes escape in a climbing climax.

But of course they go about it in completely different ways. War does it better but it also has the momentum of the previous two movies whereas Kingdom is just starting up. War is more introspective and philosophical while Kingdom plays like an old school barbarian adventure. 

I wonder if it's intentionally contrasting the actions of humans in one with those of apes in the other and the humans being opportunists, biding their time in Kingdom.",2,0

It's not groundbreaking with its material, but Jennifer Garner's performance combined with how very well written and surprisingly mature the middle and last are makes this movie a winner.
","As someone who literally watched this movie a year before I turned 13 and I'm now in my early 30s this movie to me the more I watch it as an adult the more and more I realize how good the movie actually is. I think the first act does the fish out of water BIG impression so well because Jennifer Garner is so good in the role, but it's the middle and last act where she struggles with the idea of doing adult shit and her feelings for Matty get stronger and he's conflicted with his feelings. The most mature thing this movie does is the last act where Matt tells her straight up I'm getting married. He loves her, but the reality is he made a commitment to his wife and as an adult just because you had old feelings from when you were a teenager it doesn't supersede the commitments you have now. That scene is so brilliantly written and acted that I feel like it's the final real big reality check for Jenna that her actions in her youth and bypassing her youth has ruined her life despite how successful she really was.

I think the ending where she goes back to being 13 and getting married to Matty was predictable, but I do feel they earned it by showing her the alternative.",8,0

* Exorcism of Emily Rose (**the biggest** flop on the scare factor for me).
* Sinister was almost terrifying but I‚Äôve already watched it. Twice 
* Conjuring (any).
* The Omen.
* Angel Heart (was more intense than scary, too much sex imo).
* Already seen The Others (gave me goosebumps), and Blair Witch Project (not the scariest but it was alright).
* The Babadook wasn‚Äôt really the scary for me personally (and now it's been memed to hell anyways)
* Paranormal Activities
* Hellhouse LLC (although the couple scenes where the monster is just in the room we‚Äôre scary)
* Baskin
* MOST Movies involving children, military or psychedelic focuses (Vanilla Sky vibes).
* I watched Mulholland drive. While I loved it, it didn‚Äôt really scare me.
* Japanese/Korean horror films typically don‚Äôt scare me, but they are a good watch for the plot twist.
* Midsommar (beautiful in a horrifying way, but not personally scary)
* Alien
* The Descent  
* The Strangers
* Talk to me
* Suspiria 
* Autopsy of Jane Doe


I‚Äôm really looking for a movie that will terrify me but tbh Hereditary set the bar a bit too high. The following movies have elicited some sort of fear response in me to varying degrees though:

* [This scene](https://youtu.be/Z317bw_0zdI) in Hereditary (1:05). Definitely one of the things that **scared me the most** in a movie.
* The entirety of Insidious.
* [This scene](https://youtu.be/3GXJa0SNQ1o) from the exorcist.
* [This scene](https://youtu.be/XnxgYYfIooc) from the shining. So haunting and surreal, makes you wonder what the hell is happening. It was just **so real and scary but trippy** without making you disassociate.
* [This scene](https://youtu.be/nnrT_zyumAM) from It follows
* The scene from Session 9 where Jeff sees Hank in the stairwell and he just keeps muttering himself with sunglasses on was slightly unnerving.
* The demons and the hospital scene from Jacob‚Äôs ladder were mildly scary - that‚Äôs kind of the stuff I‚Äôm looking for 
* Dinner scene from the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre was pretty intense and frightening. Remaster too
* The Visit wasn‚Äôt bad. It didn‚Äôt scare me but it was scary. Probably the best horror-comedy I‚Äôve ever seen.
* The Dark and the Wicked was a few short stops away from being scary (in my book) 


Basically, I‚Äôm looking for a ‚Äúwait, something isn‚Äôt right here‚Äù type of horror that makes you scared to sleep with the lights off. 
If I had to give you a ballpark - I‚Äôd say Herditary/Insidious vibes mixed with the demons/hospital from Jacob‚Äôs ladder with a touch of surrealism and psych horror.

And apparently, they barely even tried, as this movie got very lackluster promotion (despite having enthusiastic test screenings) and was opened up against ""Aliens."" This wasn't so much a case of a movie flopping as a movie never really getting a chance.

Which is really damn disappointing, not just for the effect it had on Carpenter's career, but because I would have loved to see more films with Kurt Russell's Jack Burton again (as was the original plan before the box office numbers came in). Having him bumble into future adventures like he does here would have been a lot of fun, especially because Russell plays the character so perfectly.

Who the fuck greenlit this?

Tired tropes about AI we've seen 10 million times. J-Lo cannot fucking act to save her life. 30 ""I'm old"" jokes in the first 5 minutes. Her character is that she drinks coffee. Main AI character sounds like a text-to-speech voice from 2008. Zero world building. Plastic sets. Blurry shaky CGI slop action scenes. Muddled shot compositions, zero flair, zero texture, zero rhythm. Actors tossed into a phoned in script about technology obviously have no idea wtf they're talking about. Peyton doesn't know scifi, has no idea what he's doing, can't direct his way out of a paper bag. Zero style. Hollywood trying to stay relevant by leeching off of J-Lo's name recognition. Fucking geniuses who decided to make this terminally stupid movie deserve to be put out of a job forever. In any other field if you sucked this bad at your job you'd be done for life.

I said my family liked it, and they seem like perfectly normal moviegoers to me. If I'm divorcing myself from my own experience of watching it once a month (not necessarily because it's *that* good, but it's easy to rewatch when I'm drunk), it really seems like a decent flick. 

The twist isn't half bad. It was written by M. Night. But it works. You don't see it coming a mile away. 

If I had to guess, the thing that draws me to it is that it has a very interesting premise that hasn't been replicated in other films. So it's the best/only film of its kind.

Last night I watched this Swiss French stop-motion animated film with no prior knowledge about it.

After a swift 60 minutes I had cried easily 5+ times and I'm still a bit raw. But these were not tears of hurt necessarily. We follow a boy from a broken home life be moved into a children's home with 6 other just as traumatised kids.

These kids are so deserving of love and family, finding it in every nook and cranny of their minimal lives yet always reaching for more.

The moment where the kids stare in the snow.... that might be one of the most powerful shots I've ever seen.

If you like stop motion animation, if you like bittersweet films about family and finding your place, if you want to watch a truly remarkable film, give My Life as a Courgette a watch.

I watched the French language version, I believe there is an American dub with a pretty stellar cast too. I don't know which is better but I can say the OG French is perfectly voice acted",2,7

The whole idea is basically Titanfall + Terminator filtered through a 13-year-old's vision of the future. Its main thematic component of AI's role in a human world is incredibly ham-fisted, and every line devoted to discussing those themes is corny. Lastly, the plot is very predictable and, ironically, feels like it was generated by AI.

BUT ASIDE FROM ALL THAT... I couldn't help but enjoy it.

To my pleasant surprise, this movie is about 60% comedy, with riffs between Atlas and her AI mech-suit Smith comprising the vast majority of the dialogue. With all that time devoted to the main character speaking to a computer, the jokes needed to land, and by-and-large they did.

At first glance, Jennifer Lopez is a questionable choice for this type of role but throughout she was very charming, displaying comedic chops and physical acting I had no idea she was capable of. The emotional component centered on her relationship with Smith is shallow, but it's also earnest and performed well enough to smooth that over.

So yeah... Not a great movie, but I can confidently say it's an entertaining action-comedy that I don't regret spending 2 hours watching. I'm a sucker for sci-fi with any kind of budget, but the laughs in this one elevate it well above most of the shlock I have subjected myself to over the years.",63,41

I really loved this Danish horror film. It terrified me and unnerved me to the core. I think it‚Äôs the social aspect of the film, watching this nice, naive couple totally walk themselves into harms way by being overly polite to their own detriment. The film left me with many questions as to why‚Ä¶ but the question gets answered by the murderious, evil Dutch couple in the end ‚Äúbecause you let us.‚Äù It really chilled me because it‚Äôs such real, human evil that you know for sure exists. No supernatural, no ghosts, no demons. Just pure, human terror. Do you think the couple trafficked the children when they found a new family/child? What do you think their true motive for doing this so many times was. Also wondering if anyone knows what the point of the tongue cutting really was, if Abel could still talk anyway. At one point Louisa says she understands him perfectly well. And he does say ‚Äúsorry‚Äù in the slide scene perfectly clearly, so does that mean he CAN really talk? I need clarification on that.

Yes, I know the Danish couple really didn‚Äôt put up a fight, and ultimately  ignored almost all of their gut feelings once the alarm bells started going off, and I don‚Äôt need everyone to comment ‚Äúbut they were so stupid!!!‚Äù I think that was the point of the movie. That naivety and politeness can put you in harms way for not trusting your gut instincts to get yourself out. The husband was weak willed and failed to protect his family, this was a classic display of a bored, depressed middle class man who doesn‚Äôt know where to find his balls and courage because he‚Äôs so numb to his mediocre family life. The wife was stronger than him, but even she ignored all her true feelings in order to be kind and polite. It was a really, really interesting social film and I really would like to see more movies like this. 

So does anyone have any suggestions? Preferably horror / thriller but even movies that are similar in how these social scenes play out would be good. Doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be the same in tone/genre. 

Also feel free to tell me what you thought of the film!

I absolutely love late 90s/early 2000 romance movies, particularly ones set in high school/college and I‚Äôve been recommended this movie so many times however when I first read the plot a few years ago, I got scared about whether or not she‚Äôd start catching feelings for a high school student despite being an adult (the way she acted with Guy was creepy still imo) but nothing she did was as bad as how the teacher was.

When he finds out Josie is 25 and not 17, he gets all upset and starts asking if she thought he‚Äôd be happy because he‚Äôs now allowed to be attracted to her (he always was before knowing she was an adult) and I was so shocked lol. I‚Äôve never really been a fan of the student teacher trope for many reasons but at least the only ones I‚Äôve ever seen were in college with a young professor around the same age as the student. This is just insane, somehow he‚Äôs more off-put by her being a legal adult and he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs upset about her being a liar because now he can‚Äôt trust her but surely a more rational thought process would be that things are better this way since if he really liked her, he can date her??? He literally even broke up with his gf of 5 years a week before & Josie obviously was part of the reason why. He even acknowledges his own creepiness in a scene on the ferris wheel where he tells Josie she‚Äôs going to have boys lining up for her when she gets older to which Josie replies by saying he has to say that because he‚Äôs her teacher & he counters with ‚Äúactually i shouldn‚Äôt say that because i‚Äôm your teacher‚Äù

This was a long and possibly pointless rant but I just can‚Äôt believe this was the movie I kept getting as a rec, I‚Äôve paused it for now because I assume they‚Äôll end up together despite him being a creep and that is so unsettling to me.

I started watching it and as soon as Pocahontas came on screen I was like Oh! That‚Äôs so interesting, that‚Äôs an actual 14 year old girl playing this part! I guess they‚Äôre going in a different direction than the Hollywoodized romance. It‚Äôll show the meeting of cultures and explore a (potentially super interesting) platonic dynamic between Pocahontas and the much much older John Smith. Great!

But no! I watched in creeping horror as the character of Pocahontas, who looks and acts and even sounds like a recent middle school graduate, is instead romanced in a disturbingly realistic way by a clearly 30 year old Colin Farrell. It straight up looks like how someone would gain the trust of and then groom for intimacy a literal pubescent child. And nobody had a problem with it? Nobody suggested a tone change, even?

I‚Äôm on a huge new world meets old world history kick and had really high hopes for this movie. But I just cannot get past the way this relationship is treated by the film as being romantic and dreamy and pure when it looks and feels so, so creepy.

Not even Raul Trujillo kicking ass can save it for me. Supposedly Christian Bale is gonna show up soon (he‚Äôs second billed) but we‚Äôre 2/3 of the way through. Gonna stick it out and see if it redeems itself somehow but I am SQUICKED

What I think of Antonioni is that according to my current tastes he is an excellent director, who if he were still making fims today I would follow, but l don't consider him a great director for me (obviousty l am totally ignoring the historical importance of his work). Some hallmarks that stick in my head are the slowness of his films and the confusion each of them leaves me with at the end.

As you can see the average is excellent considering that it is almost half of his filmography, but l have not seen more than 40% because I have imposed the rule of seeing at least 40% of the films of the great directors that I choose and moving foward only if the average rating is 3.8/5 or higher (this is because there are too many fantastic directors to know and I want to see most films only by those directors I really adore).

Apparently it‚Äôs based on a true story which is cool but probably explains why they couldn‚Äôt really do as much with the plot as they wanted‚Ä¶ my main gripe with it is they spend too much time on the relationship between the main character and his fianc√©. Understandably so. But it‚Äôs just so painfully obvious from the very beginning that it is not going to work out, and the second they got married it was instantly dysfunctional then spiraled predictably out of control. 

It‚Äôs not even that I mind that too much, I mean, especially since it‚Äôs probably what happened irl and it was a huge part of the story. But it was just so painfully obvious it made it boring, and it‚Äôs not exactly fun watching a couple argue for 35 min of a 2 hour movie. But Tom hardy is so fuckin dope in that movie he more or less completely makes up for it. Not to the point it‚Äôs a great movie but it‚Äôs definitely worth a rewatch every once in a long while

Definitely one of my fave tom hardy movies. He‚Äôs so damn good, but I just wish he had more good movies. The movies he is in are never bad because of him, he‚Äôs usually the only reason I‚Äôm even watching the movie in the first place but he just needs to be in some better written stuff. Obviously mad max is great.

On literally their first date she wanted him to stop being a gangster, and put zero thought into the fact he loved being a gangster and was never going to stop until after they were married. And same with him. He was the most pimpin club owner and could have had any girl who was more ok with his occupation. I mean if you‚Äôre a girl who‚Äôs gonna marry a gangster you have to have to be ok with that in the first place otherwise wtf are you even doing 

Like hi i just met you, but i want you to completely change everything about yourself and leave everything in your life behind. And he‚Äôs like yea sure ok let‚Äôs get married, and she‚Äôs like yea sure sounds like a great idea even though you have showed me zero reason you‚Äôll change",7,4
movies,t3_1cztwqb,1716581005.0,/r/movies/comments/1cztwqb/i_feel_like_hollywood_concerns_ruined_arrival/,Discussion,I feel like Hollywood concerns ruined Arrival,"The pitch for Arrival almost sounds like it was made for me. A movie about a linguist trying to establish communication with something truly and utterly Alien and by the way the aliens are Tralfamadorians sounds like it's absolutely my jam, and maybe it's just how much that premise excited me that left me feeling quite bitter about the movie we got, but I did not like Arrival.

I haven't read the book, so I can't speak to changes made in the adaptation, so I will look at this as its own, self contained, deeply compromised film.

The first, biggest problem, that the movie has two extremely interesting ideas being forced to compete with two extremely boring ideas that seem to be in place in order to appease stakeholders. The former are the idea of attempting to establish communication with an advance species that is absolutely alien, and Banks' becoming unstuck in time and seeing the totality of her own existence. The latter are a romance between Banks and Donnelly, and an international incident plotline that serves to create tension through a countdown.

The movie basically abandons trying to truly develop the challenges of language by reducing it to a literal montage. The movie has a lot of irons in the fire, it probably wasn't possible to really build on this without a much longer film, but it makes me sad to see that they chose to compromise this element quite so severely.

The stuff between Banks and Donnelly feels like it takes up a lot of runtime, which it probably doesn't in reality, but it feels weird because Donnelly has no role in the film. It doesn't really make sense for him to be working on Banks' project, the movie doesn't really try to give him anything to do. So he just kinda stands around, being in the film without contributing anything except filling in the love interest shaped space they carved into the script.

The international incident/showdown with China stuff is all absolutely terrible, because it feels so desperately artificial, which could maybe be forgiven if it was even mildly compelling, but the problem is this is mainly driven by Agent Halpern, a character who can be described completely as ""antagonistic"". He has no role in the film other than to be antagonistic to people and pour fuel on the fire with General Shang. Really, every single facet of this plot line absolutely sucks, and it feels cowardly, like the film didn't believe enough in its core concept to be engaging without this kind of over the top, sabre rattling, ratcheting of the stakes.

Then there's the time stuff. My minor criticism about this is that it's all fairly backloaded. If they're gonna condense the language stuff down as harshly as they did, this needs to come in early to be explored more slowly. As it is, it comes in too late and feels very rushed. Most of this stuff is great though, even if too fast, except the end. OH the end. How much I hate the end.

Banks has a child, Hannah, who has a slow and painful battle with cancer that she loses at the age of 12. With complete knowledge of how this is all going to turn out because Banks sees her entire life at once, she still decides to have Hannah, because she decided that the relationship she got to have with Hannah was greater than the pain of losing her. To me, this is wildly amoral. Never once does the immense pain and suffering Hannah experienced as she dies of cancer before she's even a teen allowed to feel like it has real moral weight. Banks doesn't weigh this against her desire to be a mother and have that experience, Hannah's pain and struggle is basically immaterial, she's a prop to serve Banks' arc, not a character for ethical concerns to be applied to. The (to me) obviously extremely fraught ethical implications of having a child who you \*know for a fact\* will experience that are never touched.

Arrival is so close to a good movie, and maybe if it wasn't so close, I'd be less harsh on it. But I really don't like the movie we ended up getting.",32,0

This elevated directors above all the other creative people involved in film, sometimes even over the actors on screen, and is the reason why we know names like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg.

However it is also often provably wrong. The most famous example is probably George Lucas, a man who was synonymous with star wars (with game and film studios bearing his name), given basically dictatorial control on the prequel trilogy, subsequently fucking up the job so badly it nearly destroyed all hope for good star wars movies in the future. That is, until Disney falls victim to the same stupid theory and gave both JJ abrams and Ryan Johnson way too much creative control, destroying all the remaining hope plus an additional little bit of hope I didn't even know I had.

(At this point I must consider if maybe star wars is the problem.)

Why did Christopher Nolan put so much emphasis on this exact moment? I‚Äôve seen people say that it exposes Oppenheimer, but I don‚Äôt think it really does.

It's so hard to believe that this was her debut. Talk about an absolute star-making turn. She won a Best Actress Oscar for this in 1969, tying with Katharine Hepburn in The Lion In Winter, another fantastic performance.

In the past we had others genres that became the most popular of the period, for example in the 50s we had Western movies, in the 60s spy movies, both in the 30s and 70s Mafia and Gangster movies, the big family comedy period of the 80s or all the action movies in the Bourne style of the early 00s.


But today superhero movies even if still standing became less or worst, generally less popular. What do you think will be the next big genre? 

‚Äî‚Äî

Edit:

I read about people discussing biopics, but even if they got to be more and more I‚Äôm not sure they qualify as a generational movie genre. 

Also I saw a lot of articles about animated movies, and even if I fell like this period is the revival of traditional animation thanks to the mixing with computer animation, it‚Äôs still not a genre but a style imho.

There are also some genres that are coming back but i will not say they are from our generation, as monster movies. We are seeing a big return of King Kong and Godzilla Movies, but they were always a thing. 

‚Äî‚Äî

Second edit: 

I feel like Videogames movies are the most anticipated new trend! It could make sense between what came out (Mario, Fallout, TLOU‚Ä¶)  and what is in the makings.

A new sci-go subgenre could be an option two, something dystopian or mixed with epic fiction. Dune was a good example of a movie that could start a trend. Let‚Äôs see how it goes.

So this guy who is amputee and barely alive after a battle in Afghanistan is chosen for this experiment called ""Source Code"" where he could be pushed into an alternative/virtual reality for eight minutes.

When a bomb goes off at Chicago station, they see it as a good opportunity to test the Source Code and send this guy back by eight minutes inside the train as one of the characters in order to find out who did that bombing.

The guy is all confused initially, he takes several rounds of these eight minutes intervals to finally figure out everything on that train and catch the bomber. Meanwhile, he questions his own existence too and finds out that he is, in fact, dead by going through the Internet.

Now, there is this Goodwin character in that experimental team who interacts with him and makes a sort of bonding. She promises to finally set him free (let him die) once he finishes the mission (of finding who the bomber is) as such pitiable existence is inhuman and ethically questionable to those administering it.

The real mystery in the movie is the ending. The last time he goes back in that alternate reality, he is determined that he will stop the bomb from going off. Goodwin and others say that it won't matter because it's a different (and simulated) reality. In Goodwin's version of reality (the real world), the bombing has already happened and there is no changing that past. Yet he asks them to put him back again one last time, so that he can try and prevent it from happening.

So he goes and prevents it from going off this time. And Goodwin cuts off his life support at that exact moment so he dies in the ""real world"". But in that ""alt world"", he freezes for a while but then continues to live on - as if the system just reboots and continues with that reality. After being surprised that he still exists, he sends an email to Goodwin about this alternative reality being more permanent than just eight minutes and briefly forecasting her of everything which is going to happen that day.

This is where the audience is most confused. How is he able to send an email from the alt reality (A) to the other or real reality (R) of Goodwin? In most other discussions on this sub, this is the question often being raised. On the other hand, if we assume that the email went to the Goodwin in the A reality of that guy only, that creates an even more scary situation: What will happen if they experiment and create another alt reality (A1) from there? Are entire worlds being generated as recursive loops one after other due to that one Source Code experiment?",12,0
movies,t3_1czict2,1716549589.0,/r/movies/comments/1czict2/day_of_wrath_shows_us_how_the_ethics_of_religion/,Review,"Day of Wrath shows us how the ethics of religion can conflict with the moral values of an individual, and how this can manifest itself into a moral dilemma.","Carl Theodore Dreyer, the director of the film, is known for the religious themes in his films‚Äîwith The Passion of Joan of Arc being his most well-known. Day of Wrath is the more subtle of the two, whereas The Passion of Joan of Arc is more direct in asking the moral questions.

Just like most other religious films, Day of Wrath asks the same moral questions: Right vs wrong... good vs evil. Is Anne wrong for falling in love with Absalon's son? Is Martin wrong for falling in love with his father's wife? Is Absalon wrong for sparing Anne's mother to get with Anne? Is Absalon's mother wrong for hating Anne? These are questions that can not be answered with a simple yes or no, and we are made aware of this through the characters‚Äîthroughout the film we see how much all the characters are in conflict with their morals.

There is a specific scene where Absalon tells Anne that her mother admitted she had the power of calling‚ÄîThat she could call the living and the dead, and they had to come. If she wishes someone dead, they died.

Anne says something very important to Absalon regarding these strange powers her mother had...


*""To think that a human being can possess such power.""*


To think a human being can possess the power to wish someone dead, and they actually die. The thing religion accuses women to be a witch for, is the same thing they are punishing them with‚Äîthey wish death on the so-called witches by burning them at the stake.

Anne asks Absalon if it is true that he spared her mother to get her, to which he never gives a direct answer‚Äîshowing us that he is in conflict with his morals. Absalon says he has a lot to discuss with God... As if he hopes that he will solve his moral dilemma with the ethics of religion. He feels conflicted because he realizes that he, not only, has the power to wish someone dead, but also has the power to wish someone alive. So, not only does he have the same power as the so-called witches, he also has the power to make his own decisions‚Äîdecisions that were always influenced by the ethics of religion. And now that Absalon becomes more and more aware that he can make his own decisions, and that his morals do not always align with the ethics of his religion, does this mean he will lose faith in his religion? Is this how his faith is being tested?

There is one shot of a written text on paper that beautifully shows how the powerful ethics of religion can conflict with your morals:


*""On this day, which was exceptionally fine, Herlof Marte was burnt, happily.""*


We know that what we are reading is absurd, but the way it is written wants us to believe it is something positive... something good. A question we could ask is; what makes religion so powerful, is it God... or is it the people that shape the ethics of religion?

As you can see, there are a lot of questions that you can ask, but none of them can be answered with simplicity. Even after the end credits have rolled, the moral questions remain alive.

One thing I have to mention is the way Day of Wrath is filmed. It was released in 1943, but it definitely doesn't feel like it. The dynamic camera movement, that moves through the rooms and at times repeatedly shifts its focus from one person to another during a conversation, gives the film a more modern feel while maintaining the strong framing and blocking you see in a lot of older films. This dynamic camera movement isn't something new for Carl Theodor Dreyer‚Äîit can be seen in his other films too, like Vampyr, Ordet and The Passion of Joan of Arc.

Even more interesting than the dynamic camera movement, is the lighting... which is absolutely beautiful‚Äîdark shadows that, either make the characters stand out by creating a contrast with the environment, or hide the characters by absorbing them in darkness. The lighting is also used to create or enhance compositions‚Äîas if it is painted onto the image.

The absence of a musical score is something I usually dislike, but in this film it worked so well. The atmosphere in Day of Wrath is not enhanced by music, it is enhanced by the dialogue and cinematography‚Äîsomething that is rarely done this effective. There are a couple scenes with a musical score, with one of those being Dies Irae, Dies Illa during the opening scene‚Äîa score, originated as a 13th century Gregorian chant melody often used at funerals, that we not only hear... but also see. During the opening scene, we see the musical notes, a translation of the original score, and eerie illustrations that all set the ominous tone of the film from the very first second.


*""Day of wrath! O day of mourning! See fulfill'd the prophet's warning! Heav'n and earth in ashes burning!""*


Many may recognize Dies Irae, Dies Illa from the opening scene in The Shining or many, many other films that use the first 4 or 8 notes of this score. Some of those are: It's A Wonderful Life, The Seventh Seal, Metropolis, A Clockwork Orange, A New Hope, The Lion King and The Fellowship of the Ring. In other words, Dies Irae, Dies Illa is the Wilhelm Scream of film music.

Day of Wrath immediately became one of my all-time favorite films. Its subtlety brings a great contrast to Carl Theodore Dreyer's other film, The Passion of Joan of Arc‚Äîwhich is also one of my favorite films.

Old in this case meaning just not on regular cinema rotation anymore, so could be as new as early 2024, but obviously that'd be extreme. I think this could be interesting to discuss because for me the movies I'd want to see in cinema aren't necessarily the same movies I'd count as my favorites. Some movies just lend themselves more to a cinema experience and others, while amazing, I don't want to watch (at the cinema) again anytime soon (Looking at you,. Grave of the Fireflies).

How about we all list some movies? :) 

If this gains any traction, I might create a little spreadsheet with some pie charts or something.

Come on hollywood give us Barkeeper, or BudgetAnalyst starring ""the Rock"" Johnson.

The first time you give us the information on your secert bee-themed unit it is fun, but after the 10th bee-themed terminology I am on the floor. Did you know bees use dance to communicate? That would have been a fun scene, where Jason does an interpretive dance to communicate his threats. 

What was this movie? OK: the idea is, 

There is an old retired lady who is scammed out of her life savings by some bastards. Only they chose the wrong old lady this time, cos her daughter is FBI, and her friend is a Beekeeper.

Now in real life, these scammers are mostly in countries like Bangladesh, but in this movie, they are bonafide Americans. This itself spoiled the premise for me. 

And imagine, what if these monsters are like those liberals you hate, who do yoga and shit? Yeah right. 

They could replace the job description of the villains to any other thing, the plot would have been the same. 

Final fight occurs in what has to be the most secure house in all of the USA, but here guarded by idiots of the highest degree. 

Their perp just waltzes in front of them but nobody takes action, just waits for the mercenaries to do their thing.

I'm looking for the title of a short movie. I think it came out in the last 5 years or so. 

It's about a group of people who get invited over to some rich guys cool mansion. They are all very different people. One is a scientist, I think, another a musician, etc. The owner gives them all top shelf drink and drugs, and then shows them some secret alien object, which then turns on them and raises a demon. 

It's a very cool movie and dripping with 80's horror nostalgia. Does someone know what I am thinking of? Thanks.

Edit. A kind redditor has provided the answer. It's called 'The Viewing' by Panos Cosmatos.

The crazy thing to me is that no matter how many times we saw this movie, to us it was great! We didn't think it had a single fault. This is considering that the CG was great for it's time and this movie played more in the background than anything. 

Fast forward to today and I just finished watching it and holy hell this movie is laughable in so many ways. The acting by the vampires and Kate is hilariously bad. Van Helsing and Dracula are over the top but they work for this movie and Carl is the saving grace in this movie he seemed like the most well rounded character. Anyways, I still love this movie.

This might only be in certain movies. But he made a lot of money somehow and think it is because he has screen presence, definitely knows martial arts and speaks a lot more clearly than his competition. Tall and not a bad-looking person by any means.

His later flicks he is clearly no longer physically able to deliver a credible performance, but judging him solely from his work **and his best work**, I see no reason to rank, for example, Van Damme above him which is maybe too easy -- but explain to my why Arnold is the better actor given that he is apparently completely unable to shed his accent in any movie. No way The Rock is a better actor although seems like he has improved over time while Steven has not.",46,0

For those who haven't seen it, this is a an early 1990s film with Bill Murray. It's about a TV weatherperson (Murray) who has been given the task of covering the annual Groundhog Day event, which is held in in a small city in Pennsylvania. The movie is a romantic comedy (Andie MacDowell being the love interest) but it's also a fantasy, because Murray gets stuck in that city and has to relive the Groundhog Day over and over again. Well, until he learns a few lessons, let's say.

When I saw the movie the first time, not only I found it boring and understandably repetitive, I didn't like the characters. Murray is kind of cynical and sarcastic. He is selfish and doesn't really care about anybody. 

But as I grew older, that's when I realized that even if you're a caring person, life can screw you over, and you gradually become cynical as a way of protecting yourself. You just don't want to believe in anything or care about people because it has not paid off in the past and because you got hurt. So you develop this new attitude of detachment, and this attitude of ""what's in it for me?"" Not saying that's why Murray acted the way he did, but he wasn't as objectionable as I originally thought.

I started to wonder what would I do if I were stuck in the same time loop? But then I realized I WAS! I didn't like the life I had and that except for little details, my days were just as repetitive. Anyhow, so I gradually saw the movie contained a lot of wisdom and it's now one of my favorites.

Have you watched a film like that?
