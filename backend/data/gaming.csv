So, we decided to find some other free racing games with LAN capability, and eventually came up short. So we widened our search to any LAN games we could find. And what? There aren‚Äôt any at all? We of course can do regular online games like fight each other in call of duty Mobile, but it‚Äôs not really the same. 

Do you guys think there‚Äôs something we missed, whether it‚Äôs a LAN supported title or possibly settings we don‚Äôt know to toggle for this? Or that there‚Äôs actually no LAN connectivity support on IOS apps, and I simply misremembered? ",2,0

If you‚Äôve played a shooter, you‚Äôve probably used a shotgun. Some are good. Some are bad. And some are **ABSOLUTELY AMAZING**.

So, I want to ask y‚Äôall what the best shotgun in gaming is.

Let‚Äôs not make it generalized too! If there‚Äôs a series with a certain awesome double barrel shotgun, you have to name a certain installment of the franchise, not the franchise as a whole. 

Doest have to be a ‚Äúregular‚Äù shotgun either!! If it‚Äôs a long stick that shoots in a circular spread pattern, it‚Äôs fair game.

Can‚Äôt wait to see your answers!! Thanks in advance

But there is this... shift, somewhere around 2005-2008ish where it just seems as if RPGs almost delights in reducing the amount of spells, meaningful stats and the like over time.  
Reducing depth.

I am just confused... why that is?  
I mean, is it to make the game easier?  
Because as someone who's first ""real"" RPG was dragon age Origins at the age of 12, and beat it without much of any issues...  
I can't really say that it seems as if depth =/= difficulty?

Or am I wrong here?  
Was it just someone who decided that less abilities / less potential for complexity meant the game would sell better?

(and I just want to emphasise, I am not saying all RPGS need to be like this, or that they should all be super mega difficult, I am not an elitist in that way. I am just... confused?

Glad to see that Firesprite and Housemarque are focusing on single-player games.

Dragon age inquisition, tried this couple of years ago and let's just say that the combat system didn't age well. I dropped it before the end of the tutorial, might giving a second chance in the future.

Ori, found to hard to navigate the map, I didn't had the time to play it regularly and everytime I entered the game I was soon lost.

I also know that most consider indie games as the last bastion of creative games that put players and the craft first. 

But as someone who has no interest in low budget platformers and the like, I feel increasingly left behind. This generation, it feels particularly unexciting to use my console for anything except an oversized roku box. 

Why do I have to boot up Skyrim, a 13 year old game, to get lost in a fantasy world? Why have I had to wait 10 years for a new GTA fix? Why do I have to dig into the old backlog to pull out a World War 2 shooter worth playing? Why was my first thought playing Ragnarok that GoW 2018 did it pretty much the same? How many seasons of Fortnite or Warzone are going to milk the same formula that was fresh a console generation ago? Why did the whole world fall in love with Animal Crossing and get nothing new to dig into. Where is Doom 3? Fallout 5? Why will my child have gone through the entire K-12 schooling system before I get to play through the FF7 story remake? Waited 10 years on Diablo 4 for a game that has no endgame and copies Diablo 3 and fixes broken systems as ‚Äúcontent‚Äù. 

Where is the new stuff? With fresh gameplay and soundtracks that I‚Äôll be humming in 20 years from now. 

And what if indie games just don‚Äôt appeal to me? A hobby I‚Äôve loved since I was old enough to speak has fizzled out, even though it‚Äôs more profitable than ever. I have hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to spend on games if I wanted, but I just cant be bothered when I open up the PS, Nintendo, or gamepass store. At least I‚Äôm currently enjoying my time with Mario Wonder, I guess. But that will be short lived.

But putting that aside, my question as you've seen Is, why the hell would some people make console wars. Why would Someone push for a gaming Company, and go against another One Who at the end makes the same thing. It's a thought process i really cant understand, i mean, the only thing i could think of why Is when you have only One console and you try to boost the console you have as much as you can, but that wouldn't be against the gaming industry, considering if One or two gaming companies were to disappear, there would be One left and they could drop whatever game they want good or bad cause they dont have competition? And what about the Memories gaming gave you? The best moments of your Life or your childhood could have happened in a videogame, the deep connection with them characters, story, gameplay, a world Building you wouldnt even Imagine in your wildest Dreams. I seriously cant understand how you would go against companies that in the end all in the same boat, which Is to produce games. If you're One of those people, even if i dont think so cause usually people like that will tend to avoid these questions, please tell me what Is your thought process?

Castles was a bit rogue like where you spend the majority of the game designing your castle and dealing with your territory and had various court sessions.  Was a fun style because you really just played it through the one location.

Castles II I remember being a lot more 4x in gameplay.  The king had passed away with no clear line of succession, so it was very much about capturing territory, resource management and allied and antagonist factions.  You could build multiple castles in that game and it was a lot larger in scale.

Does anyone remember these games and more importantly any suggestions on a game that follows the first ones formula?  Mount and Blade kinda scratched that itch, but I was curious if anyone knew of other games like that.

gaming,t3_1d5g3fg,1717220850.0,/r/gaming/comments/1d5g3fg/i_was_wondering_on_what_the_international_gaming/,,I was wondering on what the international gaming community thinks about making a game based on Hindu mythology,"I am specifically talking about Mahabharata which is a story about humanity. It has all kinds of emotions, dilemmas, twists and turns. Most of all contains a lot of action (a lot) and romance. There numerous and important characters. One game honestly wouldn't work for the amount of story that is in Mahabharata. It is the biggest epic ever told in the world. The stories teach us about humanity and the different ideologies each person around us might have. I personally think a series of games could be made out of this and it could possibly be a big hit.
The problem is most indians often easily get offended when it comes religion and if the story contains even inaccurate things, the Indian community will get absolutely fired up. So, making such and game in India with developers is not easy at least for the time being. The other factor is that the Indian gaming market is extremely small and no company is going risk such a big project due to the potential backlash and no previous feedback. But I think the international gaming audience really owns games which are passionately made and are actually fun and immersive. A format these games could is the god of war format since these games need to be more linear. I just want to know what the international gaming community thinks about this. This is a project which has stories which the gaming community has never explored. Do you guys think a us, Japanese or any other gaming would take up such a massive project with the amount of risk it comes with?",31,0

Second, considering both key groupings have been around since OG Castle Wolfenstein, and considering consoles have offered multiple easily selectable controller preferences since the 90s as well, why do modern devs simply have an easy way to select ESDF or WASD rather than considering WASD as the only option?

Where's this question coming from? After recently trying a game on PC where you simply could not change keybinds to anything other than WASD, I simply noped out as there is no way I'm reprogramming nearly 25 years of gaming muscle memory. It then struck me how odd it is that console games have been offering an easy way to choose alternative stick/d-pad/trigger setups for ages yet PC devs are apparently blind to the idea.",43,0

Then while fighting some guards at the Ultra-Luxe, I pressed the pip boy button for too long and poof, the flashlight worked. Then I gave veronica a dress worn by the guards and she taught me a move that required me to block, and I was like ‚Äúwhat the hell you can block attacks??‚Äù And that‚Äôs where I learned about both of those basic actions.

Have you guys experienced something like this where you have no idea about the most seemingly basic actions in the game that you just gave up knowing just to find out about them after you‚Äôre a handful of hours playing in? Share your experiences below!

Edit: I just want to add this cause you guys might not know, but if you have an enemy that throws a grenade/bomb, before they throw it, shoot the grenade/bomb in their hand via the VATS mode(where you can choose what part of their body to target) and it will explode on them instead.

But with the latest 9th gen consoles, it really doesn't seem like much exciting stuff has happened at all.

Now yes, everyone can quickly go ahead and say that it's because both the PS5 and the Xbox Series X/S had rough start due to COVID. But it's more than just that.

Sony has now started to introduce their exclusive titles on to the PC platform. However they still get crapped on for their ridiculous anti-consumer practices. Including the requirement of a PSN account on PC.

And as for Microsoft, it doesn't seem like they care about their consoles anymore. But rather they're more focused on cloud gaming with their Xbox game pass service. And then there's the recent controversy of them shutting down several studios because they couldn't make them quick money despite the success.

Also another reason seems to be the pricing. Consoles have gotten really expensive and so have their accessories. And the games have gotten pretty expensive that people would rather prefer to play on PC while waiting for a discount to appear on steam or just straight up pirate the game.

But what do you think? What will be the future of console gaming?

I have a friend who fucked up a few fingers on her right hand, and as a result of this she cannot really use her mouse much. This upsets her heaaavy

She plays overwatch the most the most, but she also likes rhythm games (osu, project sekai..)

She plays limbus company sometimes as well as Roblox.

She dislikes strategy games I believe.

Would you fellas be willing to give some recommendations for (preferably coop, although singleplayer is ok) games that wouldn't require heavy use of her mouse?

Would be nice if they are free, although if it's under 10‚Ç¨ I'll take it

Oh and she likes hello kitty and Miku (vocaloid in general) a lot and cute things as well so if there are any games like that that would be very cool, although it's not a requirement 

Thank you very much in advance gamers :)

I was wrong, I picked RE2 up on a sale in 2020 and had a blast playing as Leon despite not having a clue and having to resort to google to try and figure out some puzzles. Overall the gameplay was fun and I was itching for more.

I played 3 afterwards and had fun. I played 7 as it was on PlayStation plus and oh boy. This game made me love the series even more but it also scared me shitless. Biohazard was obviously a different take on the series, not third person or fixed camera but first person instead which made the game more frightening which in my opinion is a great angle for all horror games. Village wasn‚Äôt as scary but was still just as fun. I pre ordered RE4 last year and had a blast, one of the best games that I have played.

It took forever for her to explain herself, but she finally showed me a recording. Basically she was on a horse or something and out of nowhere she launches into the sky and goes pretty much the entire length of the map and then lands and dies.

Some games have such a huge lore and setting that the amount of stories that can be told are limited by their genre, yes at the beginning is perfectly fine, the game needs to set itself, maybe it will work, if it does, you continue the formula, but eventually you might run into a a wall since there could be so many stories that you could tell but... Well the game is this specific genre but if I tell this story I might have to change it and the formula worked so far, why change it? Makes sense right? But I've been thinking about spin-off games that could allow certain franchises to expand into their lore and tell really interesting stories about their world. 

Resident Evil: so... I get the consensus on it's genre and that 6 was not well received for being more action than horror survival. Personally 6 is one of my favourite RE games, well I've played but a few, RE:4, 6, 2 remake and operation racoon city, loved all of them. Now I really liked 6 because it was different, Leon campaign had a classical feeling, Chris a bigger military operation, Jake had the chase component from 2 and 3 with the ustanak, and Ada had that feeling of being more of a secret agent. Now I loved the classic style of RE, but operation racoon city and Chris's campaign on 6 scratched an itch, I would love to see more major military operations like the first 3 chapters of Chris's campaign, with a squad maybe with strictly npc squad mates or that could also be played, but I think we could delve deeper into the BSAA with this, in a more action packed game, trying to stop bio terrorists or contain outbreaks as members of a major military operation, having to fight through cities filled with either zombies or j'avo like enemies with support from helos tanks, allied squads. I would very much appreciate a parallel series of games in that style.

Assassin's creed: so this franchise has done this, while up to syndicate there was low variability of gear, weapons in a more straightforward way to the game (idk how to really explain it, sorry) the newer ones with origins, odyssey and Valhalla, were RPGs with abilities, huge weapon variability, certain choices and branched dialogue. This is great and for me it worked, loved all 3 RPG styled games, but the franchise continues to be limited to far in the past even though it acknowledges more recent events. 
So a third person shooter type game would work with more recent events, like WWI, WWII, the Korea and Vietnam wars, Far West, even the cold war could be a great setting for an AC game. 

Now sorry for long post, but tell me what you guys think? And also share what other games you think could benefit from expanding genres? ",9,3

In most cases the attack comes out after a slight delay: in Metal Gear Rising, you technically ""block"" first  before you perform a counter, same goes for Bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden.

But there are a few games where you can retaliate *the very moment* an enemy's attack hits you. You can do that in Nier Automata with the Counter chip, Ghost of Tsushima have something similar with Standoffs. And by far the most satisfying ones for me are Royal Release from DMC and Flourish from Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae. They are so satisfying to pull off I wish they were in every game.

I get that you need a certain style of game to have such flashy moves, but... feels like we don't have enough of those.

These types of interfaces just happens to be a vanishing breed these days unfortunately with plenty of games not bothering with custom keyboards anymore. As you can imagine, calling up the console-supplied keyboards like this can horribly clash with the established game interface and thus taking you out of it momentarily. It's possible their prevalence can be explained with the popularity of PC games that likely has you use your own keyboards for text input anyway but since this can happen even with exclusives (as is the case with Paper Mario Thousand Year Door remake on Switch to name one recent example), it makes me wish for proper in-game keyboards even more.

How some parts of the Gaming industry seems to venerate the movie industry.,"This is something I have thought of for a long time., the annoying frustration with gaming and the gaming industry at a AAA level having a strange hardon for the movie industry.  
An industry that by every metric, is worse than the gaming industry.

It earns less, its artform is way less interactive, resulting in much less of an artistic function. Compared to the gaming industry is it way darker and more terrifying by comparison (Overall, the gaming industry have some nasty rancid shit in it too, the movie industry just have a tanker truck instead of an outhouse.)

But still is there this.. weirdly ""movie centered"" aspect to a fair few AAA games.  
""Cinematic games"" (which aren't all terrible to be fair) that significantly reduces gamings main strength (interactivity) , a strange obsession with movie stars and celebirty VA's in recent years.

Even more emphasised by events like TGA being stuffed full of movie stars, instead of celebrating the industry's celebrities and people of reknown.

Why is the gaming industry seeming so intent on aping an industry that by all merit is less successful and more corrupt?  
Combined with the fact that, lets face it, the ""grand cinematic experiences"" are rarely the games that actually are worth the most, even if you only consider the year of release.

I remember back before TLOU came out there was this trailer showing the game, and the combat looked insanely fluid. Like all game trailers, it overpromised, and whilst really good, the combat in the final game didn't quite live up to what was shown.

The Last of Us 2 lives up to that trailer.

Every animation feels both really fluid yet powerful when needs be. The finishers look great, especially when the environment such as walls or tables are involved. How the enemies react is also really well done, limb loss is as gruesome and realistic as you could ask for. I'm not usually one for gore, but I can't really fault it in this game.

There is also a great sense of claustrophobia in many of the firefights; you don't feel more powerful than your enemies. I think the lack of ammo is a strong contributing factor to this, you have to mix it up with throwables, melee and stealth.

I've just got out of the Sarawak Hotel with Dina, this game is living up to my hopes and more.",36,0

Can you re-use the engine and the code/scripts from the old game? Like Dead Space the initial game on PC wasn't too old and maybe you can re-took most of the work?

But what about a bigger remake like Metal Gear Solid 3 that should be release within month? The original game was release in PS2 and migrate it to Unreal Engine 5 looks to be huge as you cannot re-use the code/script from the PS2 engine.

I imagine many people here are familiar with The Elder Scrolls (and Skyrim in particular) and how they've implemented skill growth: In order to become good at one skill, you just do a lot of repetitions. Exactly how we learn new skills in real life, so it's really immersive and cool right? In theory, yes, but in practice... ehh. Forging thousands of iron daggers makes you good at smithing daggers, but it doesn't make you a masterful blacksmith on its own right. Still makes more sense than spamming a flame jet + healing beam on your own horse (who doesn't seem to mind) in order to improve your magic abilities though.

Then I dug through some other games that use the same philosophy and see how they measure up. Runescape + WoW are another familiar examples, so familiar that I knew about it even though I've never really gotten into MMOs. From what I've gathered, it did entice many players to afk farm their non-combat skills like Mining/Fishing/Foraging (or whatnot) because those things took a lot of time to rank up.

Final Fantasy 2 had similar system too, and from what I've heard the consensus is... it was done poorly. Again, haven't played this one either, but YT videos seem to recommend spamming all your curative & stat ailment spells, lingering in battle for long as possible to rake up your character stats. Doesn't sound like my cup of tea to be honest.

Likewise, Grandia 1 (a game I HAVE played, for a change) uses a similar mechanic as FF2. And likewise it also encourages you to spam your specials and spells until you run out of SP and MP. You do have character levels and the regular EXP system on top of it, but character levelups happen so slowly you're better off pumping your skills to get those stat bonuses.

Mount and Blade -series does that with weapon skills, although you can use Skill Points to up your skills to a certain threshold. It doesn't automatically make you a master swordsman or a crack shot, but at least you can be a semi-competently trained soldier from the get-go.

One game that seems to implement this mechanic rather well is Kenshi, ironically thanks to being able to automate some tasks. For example, setting a character to mining ore and hauling it to a container improves following stats: Laboring (because mining), Athletics = Max running speed (improved by walking/running) and Strength (improved by moving while encumbered). Athletics and STR are useful stats for combatants as well, so you don't really feel like wasting time ""just to up one non-combat skill"". Even when you lose a fight, you often come out of it with better weapon skills, Dodge/Blocking and Toughness (assuming you didn't fight carnivores who just eat you after downing you).  

I'm sure there are some other examples I've missed out, but from what I've seen and experienced so far, Learn By Doing easily leads to boring & repetitive gameplay. Leveling up via EXP and picking up Skills/Perks at level ups ain't perfect either, but I can see why many games prefer that implementation instead.

  
What are your thoughts on ""Perform skill to improve it"" mechanic? Do you guys have more examples of it done well in video games?",126,199

The strategic level, on the other hand, involves a central objective for each team to either attack or defend.

For example, Overwatch.  The tactical level includes two damage heroes, a tank hero, and two support heroes protecting, healing, and reviving each other while killing off the enemy repeatedly.  While the strategic level involves pushing a payload toward the defending team's side of the map, or capturing and holding a control point.

Same thing for Rainbow Six Siege.  The tactical level being the various operators and their unique weapons, armor, and siege/defense equipment that could compliment each other in a team.  The strategic level being the objective for one side to defend for dear life, and the other side to eventually attack.

Aside from frame rates dropping every now and then, the gameplay was very smooth, the graphics are amazing and I just really, really enjoyed playing the game and would recommend to any fans of fantasy or first person shooters. 

Not ashamed to say I cried a little when it was over. I've not felt this way about a game in a while. This game and the studio deserved so much better because what they created was, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Relationships were built well enough that the emotional story moments hit just right, the lore of the game is rich and the world-building is up there with the best I've experienced. 

All in all, I'm so disappointed that the studio ended up laying off half of their staff because this game deserves a sequel. There's so much more potential to explore, and a perfect villain set up with >!Kirkan!<, and the mention of other areas outside of those explored gives promise to another part of the world ready to be brought to life. I hope the studio is able to rebuild and make a sequel because I know the game has found some success on game pass. 

I'd give this game a 9.5/10. I have no metric for my scoring system, and I've deducted half a point for the frame rate issues. It's an overlooked masterpiece that deserves more. ",16,0

I've been looking for score attack focused FPS/TPS games and have just not found anything that really scratches that itch.

Ideally I'm looking for something that's, 

* **Story-lite** (story is fine, but I'd like to avoid games with long walk & talks. Keep things segmented)
* **Score Focused** gameplay is focused around combos, attaining high scores, not neccessarily around high-speed or low completion time
* **First/Third Person** perspective. I've got immense respect for bullet hells and shmups but not my cup of tea

Ideally also not rogue-likes or arena based games. For me part of the fun is running and re-running levels to maximize score and lean the flow, which arenas and rogue-likes don't tend to deliver on.

The closest thing I've found sofar are the following;

* **The Club** - Great score mechanics, combo system, fast and fluid levels, though feels unfinished (characters and weapons are poorly differentiated) and GFWL leaves it pretty broken on PC.
* **Killrun** - Very good game for speedrunning and movement-tech entheusiasts. However 100% focused on speed, no real scoring mechanics here which is a bummer
* **Neon White** - pretty and fluid, with some really fun mechanics, but again focused almost exclusively on minimum time over any kind of scoring or combos.
* **Ultrakill** - a good choice with some great combo play. Unfortunately it's also much faster at a baseline than I can comprehend.
* **Bulletstorm** - Pretty good fit, though I find the constant humor pretty grating and the walk & talk sections destroy the pacing
* **Vanquish** - a good option, though the scoring aspects feel like an afterthought rather than a core measure of how you're playing.
* **Soul King** - a game I developed that fills this niche I've been thirsting for for years, but obviously after hundreds of hours in dev/testing I've thoroughly explored this one. 

I really apprecite any recommendations folks can make.

Ports on new hardware were expected to have new upgrades or features. It wasn't considered special. If something was drastically changed then we call it a remake like Resident Evil on Gamecube.

Now these upgraded ports are called remasters regardless of the effort. A game like RE on Gamecube would probably be viewed as a remaster today.

It feels the term remaster is a marketing gimmick to sell ports of old games.",17,0

It was a blast and easy to track not just the winner of each round but also stats like Most Eagles or Fewest Bogies. Stuff to brag about.

The gameplay of stroke-play Mario Golf worked really in our casual setting, as each player of any age/skill level has their own turn so others could grab a snack or something without stress. You're basically just playing your best game against yourself relative to the competitors, as golf is.

I have a track ball that we can use for Golden Tee next.

But I'm looking for any other suggested games for another ""tournament"" that fit that sort of style of being passive and competitive.

I'm welcome to suggestions for other golf/golf-like games. But it would be cool if somebody had an idea for something other than sports. Some game I can't think of right now where players take turns to do something and get the most widgets along the way in the least amount of time. That would be perfect.

Like we could play Tetris and track scores, but that's hard to stretch over a couple of nights and there aren't many other stat-lines to observe.

Thank you for your time and any possible suggestions.

Any console/PC/arcade emulation possible. Just think of those games where you had the most fun passing the controller and watching your competitors turn and laughing and all that kind of stuff. And my pops loves Excel, so the more possible stats/outcomes.

Multiplayer doesn't even have to be an aspect of the gameplay, but that kind of makes it more fun for the participants if the design and intent is there. But I will take single player pass-the-controller suggestions as well.",7,3

gaming,t3_1d3f632,1716997059.0,/r/gaming/comments/1d3f632/alan_wake_2_was_disappointing_review/,,Alan Wake 2 was disappointing (review),"Gonna preface this by saying I haven't finished it yet, I'm about 10 hours in. Having heard how amazing it was, not only from critics but people I hold a deal of reverence for, mainly Jacob Geller, and having enjoyed other horror games like Resident Evil and Dead Space, I thought this would be the perfect game for me. Unfortunately, as I'll get into, I don't think its as good as its hyped up to be.



My main criticism is Saga - the protagonist for most of the game. I'll be blunt; she's a bland, lifeless character, both in writing and in voice acting. She hardly ever expresses any emotion, surprise as to what's happening, and even when she does it feels stilted. This is a particularly bad problem because on her side of the game, the drive to continue is dependent on caring about her and her family, and when it hardly even sounds like she cares for her family, I definitely don't either. It feels like a chore to play as her as I don't really care what she does or where she goes.



The second problem is the general gameplay - though the overall narrative is intriguing, the moment to moment gameplay is uninteresting. It generally boils down to fetch quests and walking to locations without much in between. Occasionally there'll be people to talk to (which as outlined earlier, isn't much better). This is plain boring. My best guess is that these sections are supposed to be scary or something to that effect, but, to me at least, they failed in this aspect and I was just bored waiting to get to whatever the next objective was. Take other games for examples of how this can be done better - Resident Evil 2R has you mapping out routes, taking stock of your limited resources, planning ahead and offers combat choices (i.e. the dismemberment system). Resident Evil 4R throws in tense combat situations frequently to keep you on your toes. Dead Space offers what is essentially a mix of these 2. Now, I understand that this isn't a Resident Evil game, but there needs to be something there to keep the player engaged.



There is combat in Alan Wake 2, but it feels a little underbaked. Shine a flashlight, hit the weak spot, then shoot until dead. Its something, but most of the time you're just shooting a slow moving target repeatedly until it dies. Not the worst combat system, but far from the best.



Finally, the detective system. You find clues in the world and piece them together on the detective board, in attempt to solve the mystery of the cult. Sounds great right? In theory, this would be engaging, however, in practice, the implementation is lacking. Saga tells you where to get the clues. All you have to do is drag the clue to the right area on the board, and then Saga will come up with her own conclusions. Its like the game doesn't trust the player to work anything out on their own. All the work is done for you and there's nothing for you to even do. Imagine if you had to gather the clues yourself and actually piece them together yourself in a puzzle-like way, similar to how Outer Wilds handles its mysteries. It would make for a much more interesting system than what we got. Its a unique idea, but not one handled particularly well.



I've only touched on what I found brought the game down here, however despite that, there's still a lot of good in the game: Alan's segments are great, with much more variety than Saga's - talk show scenes, the music chapter (god that was so good), the light mechanic (which, while never used to its full potential, at least required some thought), a change in environment (which was more appealing to me personally), a sense of paranoia throughout, the ""author"" mechanic (which gave you tangible feedback for your actions), and a protagonist that I could actually feel invested in. And in both segments, the environments are very well realised, and most of all, the game tried something new. It tried to be different. I respect that, even if it failed somewhat in its execution.



I'd give it a 6/10. Worth playing for what it does right and what unique ideas it brings to the table, but unfortunately flawed in many ways.

Shadow Company was a real-time tactics game, similar to commandos (not a commandos-like!). It was not an overwhelming success, but it was ok and had good reviews.

So I googled a bit and it turns out that in 2012 there has been a ""Shadow Company: The Mercenary War"" in development. Why have I never heard of it? Well, because it was developed as a Free2Play Ego-Shooter without any resemblance to the first game.
It looked really bad, and the Shooter market was highly competed and oversaturated, so it was never finished and released.

On the other side, players who liked the old commandos and spellbound games where starving in the 2010s, until Mimimi games finally redeemed us in 2016. Im sure that an actual Shadow Company 2 would have done better than that cheap cash grap attempt.

Today, Shadow Company is abandonware. I know that only few people have ever heard of it. A more popular example for this occurrence might be ""Sacred 3"" that was very different to the first two parts and completely failed.",57,14

His arms and neck started slowly getting longer. After a few minutes my game finally crashed, and I was laughing so hard I started crying because Shep had a solid 5-6 inches of neck going there.

An Original PlayStation, I loved it.   
At about 7 I remember getting my own Xbox. This would have been in 2005 just before the 360 came out.

I mostly played kids games like Zapper, Blinx the Cat and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger on it. Eventually I'm 9 and my friends are talking about playing ""Halo"", I harmlessly ask my parents about it and after a long debate on if it was okay for me to play a game with guns in it, I get a copy of Combat Evolved.   
I continue to talk to everyone at school about Grunts and the UNSC and never click we're not playing the same game.

My mum decided to buy me a PSP around this time, and I adored that. My step-dad had a PS2 so I just thought it was one of those but handheld! My Gameboy SP was replaced. 

Finally, in 2009, my family get a Wii, and I am now 11, I go to the shops myself and discover the Xbox 360 Exists and decide I simply must have one. I get one on my twelfth birthday.    
I finally get on Xbox live and play a bunch of games up until I'm 16, until I finally transitioned to PC gaming for the rest of my days.

It only clicked a couple of years ago that I was behind for so long, I've spoken to my parents about this and apparently it was half intentional. It was a lot cheaper for them during a difficult period for them financially to buy older second hand games, But I also appreciate it!

gaming,t3_1d34cj9,1716959192.0,/r/gaming/comments/1d34cj9/multiplayer_games_and_player_culture/,,Multiplayer games and Player Culture,"So I've realized that one of the reasons I havent been enjoying multiplayer competitive games is the player culture. What is that? Well, I'll explain by example. Using Smash Bros, Dead by Daylight, and Tony Hawk Underground Pro.

Case 1: Smash Bros

As a long time fighting game player, I've always ran into an issue where I get to a point where there's no one I know who's fun to play with, they're either too good, or too bad. When I happened upon Smash as a kid, it was like a prayer being solved. The chaos of Smash ensured that skill gaps were less severe. 

Eventually, the competitive Smash community became the most prevalent group of Smash players. Nowadays, I'm looked at as if I have brain damage if I want to play with items on. Most players don't even want to play on 90% of stages available in game, because they aren't close enough to Battlefield or Final Destination. Getting a group of friends to want to play 4 player free-for-all is a struggle even. Everyone would rather play 1v1 no items, 2:30, because that's how the competitive scene does it. I venture to guess its the same for many of you.

 To me, this is ridiculous, why order a burger just to take off all the toppings? Of course, that's also a solved issue now. Due to the prevalence of the competitive scene, developers are finally earnestly trying to make platform fighters(a genre delineation that pretty much didnt exist for the first 15 years of smash's life, and btw, Shrek Super Slam is a Power Stone clone, not a Smash Bros. one), though pretty much only Rivals of Aether and Brawlhalla are relevant.

Either way, the point im making here still stands, Smash Bros. current player culture is no longer interested in the original selling point of the franchise.

Case 2: Dead By Daylight

This is more about the genre as a whole, for those who don't know Dead by Daylight is an asymmetric multiplayer game where theres 1 killer, and 4 survivors. Pretty much every other game in this genre is a horror game, so they all have similar culture. 

In DBD, you'll often hear one player type complaining about the behavior of the other, and what actions are 'kosher' in gameplay. Killers are often expected to give player's the hatch, and of course, its a game where there's an objective benefit to camping. You can also choose to intentionally leave survivors downed, instead of putting them on a hook(effectively an altar you put someone on to cash out a kill), this is called slugging. as you can imagine its possible for a Killer to leave most players downed and just harass the living player around the map. On the flipside, Survivors can equip items to inhibit the Killer, whether it be a blinding flashlight, the ability to negate fall damage or quick heals. Both parties can do obnoxious actions to each other. Another odd trend of the player culture is survivors will just...wait...at the exit gate just to troll the killer and force them to be in the game longer, they may even make sure to tank some hits from the killer if they know the killer's ability isnt useful enough to stop them.

This results in a player culture where a ""good"" match is the one where both teams have to have a certain amount of charity to their actions, rather than just doing the most efficient actions to win. Seriously. Just go over to r/deadbydaylight and type '4K,' you'll get 100s of posts complaining about how the Killer's dedication to a swift victory is annoying.

Case 3: Tony Hawk's Underground Pro

This is a mod for THUG that returns the online features. The online features many of the game's single player content, just with the ability to score attack or time attack them with a lobby of people. The most popular being standard score attack. 2 minutes, get the highest score. There's just one issue. Anyone who's played enough Tony Hawk knows that if you're still in a combo when the timer hits 0, the run is still active. 

Why is that a problem? Well, there is ONE domineering goal for the THUGPro community - Billing. Billing is the idea of playing to score a billion points. With the aforementioned timerstop - really only the last second of a Trick Attack run matters. It determines what you're doing with the next 5 minutes of your life. Either you are also attempting to Bill, going around the entire map doing an infinitely long combo, or you're combo was already over. Meaning you are now stuck waiting for the last currently active combo to end before the game mode ends. I've seriously been in lobbies where there was a single guy comboing for 10+ minutes while our only option was to leave lobby or wait.

  
Summary:

 In each one of these cases, there's a completely different idea of what ""the right way to play"" is. The Smash community is concerned with a competitive ruleset, where chaos is pretty much eliminates any chance outside of character specific mechanics. DBD is concerned with maximizing fun for both parties, essentially using an honor system to eliminate the use of ""cheap"" tactics. And THUGPro epitomizes obsessiveness, since there's no direct player interaction, THUGPro players act as if there ARE no other players, despite the fact that the other players are restricted during play.

If you are like me, and find yourself bored and or miserable in a multiplayer game's landscape, despite liking the game mechanically. Keep the player culture in mind, personally, I'd honestly avoid MOST team based games, as it often just allows other players to blame  each other for losses and mistakes. I'd also avoid games that have released more than 10 years prior to your first time playing, as they're often filled with very...anti-newbie players.

Are there any games you've played where the player culture ruined or enhanced it? I'm curious what the landscape is like as someone who plays very few of them now",17,0

(outside of hardware),"I remember years and years ago WoW was considered pretty expensive at $15ish/month.  But now that doesn't seem to be an issue.  I know its common to buy new games every month.  And I know people spend a ton on games that have transactions, though that seems pretty frowned upon.  And some games are like hundreds of dollars to get all the expansions.  

So what would you consider a chill amount to spend on gaming personally per month?  How about on a single game per month?  Would that even be a different number for you?

","What I'm going to describe now is something a lot of you maybe won't understand or think it's silly, but it's something real for me, and the reason I'll forever remember chants of sennaar as a game.

Since childhood I've always been fascinated with videogames, but I live in a third world country that unfortunately taxes everything through the roof.

So it is really hard to be able to enter this world for real here, just like thousands I've grown up watching others play on the internet cause it was the closest thing that little me had to be able to enjoy the games he loved so much.

Fast forward to nowadays, I got my Xbox one 2 months ago and took one month for me to begin signing gamepass, and in gamepass I found chants of sennaar never having heard of it and after reading the description it gained my interest and I downloaded it. 

Today at exactly 01:37 AM I managed to finish the game's true ending, the first time that I finish a game myself, not watching others play it and a game I found myself too.

I know it might sound ridiculous that me currently at 19 y old is crying because of a videogame that doesn't even have a sad ending. 

But idk what to say honestly, how do explain this feeling? I don't even know why I decided to post this.

I just feel so happy...really happy.

Things have not been easy recently, looking for a job, looking into college options, having to support my small brother through the divorce of my parents, and all of that without most my friends since (I live in a pretty countryside town and my school was in another town).

But even tho things might not been easy, atleast today the nerd child inside my heart has the satisfaction to see that it can finally seek solace in the hobbie it loved so much.

Anyways, that's my motive why I think this game will probably stick to my memory like bubblegum.

If you're getting in the game now or anytime soon relish every single moment, you have a wonderful journey ahead.

And if you find myself in the same situation I grew up in, Bright up! One day you'll reach that which you desire so much.

Be safe out there.",50,296

gaming,t3_1d2rsbi,1716923822.0,/r/gaming/comments/1d2rsbi/recommendations_for_fantasy_games_on_xbox/,,Recommendations for fantasy games on Xbox?,"Hey guys, so my girlfriend recently got Breath of The Wild on her switch and I occasionally beat the enemies for her that she can‚Äôt. It really gave me a taste for that style of game and I‚Äôd love to find something similar on Xbox.        

So I‚Äôm hoping for something with:      
- **Fantasy** - you know the deal. A sort of magical world with beasts and monsters or whatever. I‚Äôd really prefer if it were **NOT** ‚Äú***dark fantasy***‚Äù. I‚Äôm a huge fromsoftware buff and love their games‚Ä¶ but I really want a change of pace with a game that has a bit of a brighter world filled with a little more welcoming life.         
- **Relatively challenging combat** - breath of the wild has the obvious dodge and parry mechanics which give the combat enough of a challenge for it to stay interesting through out. It doesn‚Äôt have to be the same difficulty as fromsoftware games, but I just don‚Äôt want combat that‚Äôs just mashing one button or just so easy that it becomes trivial. I prefer dodge and parry mechanics.        
- **Weapons** - I‚Äôd prefer if there were a decent bit of weapons for the player to enjoy. It‚Äôs not a deal breaker by any means, but I know I enjoy games when I‚Äôm not pigeonholed into using a single weapon.      

That‚Äôs it.        
Any and all recommendations of games that fit the bill that you enjoy would be amazing. Thank you guys in advance!

It probably doubles the number of hours players invest in an ARPG. At least it does for me. 

I love the experience of not knowing what kind of attributes might be involved in the next enemy encounter or where these encounters might take place and I love the lottery aspect of what items may drop. 

Games like the Borderland series have found this to be extremely successful so why are games like AC, Horizon Zero Dawn or Ghost Of Tsushima doing the same? Instead of having endgame encounters with larger groups of enemies or, at least endgame powered mini-boss types. I‚Äôm fighting the same common enemies using endgame level gear. And instead of finding powerful/interesting items, I end up with a stash of thousands of crafting items with nothing left to upgrade. At which point I stop playing a game that I would love to continue enjoying.

To me this seems like a no-brainer which should have been made the standard a long time ago. Even if it‚Äôs a matter of devoting a large percentage of budget to one aspect of development over another, I‚Äôd rather the map be a little smaller or graphics a little less amazing for the sake of a more interesting endgame.

Most games don't offer anything other than either cosmetics or a much harder difficulty. Usually it doesn't add anything other to me than artificial replayability. 

When I spend 50-100 hours finishing a game, there's zero incentive for me to jump back in and do it again, but this time with *more cosmetics*. Or if it's the difficulty, after finishing I'd have to take a break because restarting the game and replaying all the missions you've already finished just feels like a slog to me. And then when you do might wanna jump back in, the games hard as shit. (this doesn't apply to souls-stans, they're built different idk)

A game that you love despite how many years go by?

For me, it would have to be 

Haunting Ground (PS2): Fantastic survival horror that is criminally forgotten at this point. Great cast of characters, cool alchemical references, terrifying themes, Fiona and Hewie are a great protagonists, with great villains. The location is also really well made and honestly, scary. It should‚Äôve been so much more successful if you ask me.

Breath of Fire Dragon Quarter (PS2): Highly underrated, minimalistic but highly original and unique dungeon crawler with a great combat system and a very unique roguelike story progression. I understand that fans of BOF probably hate it but I absolutely love it.

Lost Odyssey (X360): Made at a time when industry had moved away from the JRPGs but to me, was perfect proof of how fantastic JRPGs can be when well done. Brilliant OST, great story, cool characters, cool world, fun and engaging combat. One of my favorite JRPGs of all time.

Deadly Premonition (X360). Low-budget Twins Peak in videogame format with awful everything except fantastic voice acting (mostly), and a brilliant story and characters. I am still hateful towards the main villain for what he did to one of the characters.

The Missing of JJ Macfield: √ºber-obscure game made by Swery65. Follows a girl searching for her friend who disappeared. The gameplay has you exploring 2D environments but the twist is that in order to progress you must harm yourself to progress. So expect gore albeit unrealistic gore, like rolling your head through a small hole to progress. Eventually it makes sense but regardless, brilliant.

Worthy of mention:
Binary Domain (X360): Shooting robots (Gears of War-style) but a fantastic story and cool characters. Great game.

With *Furiosa* in theaters, I like many others I'm sure have recently gone through the  Mad Max movies (gotta give the crown to *Fury Road*) and decided to fire up the game as well. It takes place in a *Fury Road* influenced incarnation of the wasteland. 

Hand to hand combat is akin to the Arkham games - visceral and hard hitting, the vehicular combat is a blast, it's got satisfying progression, and a huge map to explore. Story is fine, but that's not the main draw. Charismatic characters. Great pacing. The upgrade system for Max & your Car (which is a character unto itself) is very satisfying. Graphics are not amazing by today's standards but still look good in my opinion and the sound design is also well done. Most importantly the game FEELS great. You feel like that Road Warrior searching for a righteous cause. 

It's not a perfect game. Sometimes the camera is a little tricky, sometimes side quests and scavenging can get a tad repetitive but overall the game is solid. They did a great job capturing the feel of the wasteland, fleshing it out beyond the movies in a way that feels totally natural. 

I would just love to see this game get more love because it deserves it. It's on Steam/Xbox/Playstation and is now normally $20 but often goes on sale for like $5.

I was looking for titles who are must play in your opinions, i personally prefer games with a good story over extremely compelling gameplay but if they have both i am not gonna complain.

I recently experience most of Bioware's RPGs, i tried something from Larians and Obsidian but the story couldn't grapple me totally..  
Things like Metro, Bioshock, Ezio's Trilogy, the BannerSaga, the Witcher,the various Telltale titles, A Plague Tale(s)  
Genre, graphic or style are all welcomed (well maybe not 8bit... 8bit makes my eyes bleed) and if YOU consider it an underappreciated gem all the better :D

gaming,t3_1d1yigg,1716834953.0,/r/gaming/comments/1d1yigg/my_take_on_the_every_screen_is_an_xbox_thing/,,"My take on the ""every screen is an Xbox"" thing ","There's a lot of talk about the whole ""every screen is an Xbox"" vision of Microsoft. Where no matter where you are, either on an Xbox device, a PC, a Smartphone and even sometimes a PlayStation or a Nintendo console, you are playng ""Xbox"" with Xbox Games, your account, your progress ecc. all saved and and always with you.

Now, of course this causes a lot of controversies and understandably so. But i want to concentrate on the ""why are they doing this"" side of things.

The first take everyone have, again understandably, is that ""Xbox doomed they have to put everything everywhere because they doomed""

The other supposed reason is that Microsoft, at acquisition finished, have seen the general money spent on Xbox and wanted the money back asap.

But that last part dosent really make a ton of sense to me. A port, while easier than before, still takes months to make. And even more to approve and decide. The development of the ports  of the famous ""4 games of the apocalypse"" released on Switch and PS5 started **months** before the announcment, and especially **months** before the Activision acquisition was finalized. Even before the ""ultra iper exclusive"" Starfield was released. 

This shows that this is not a sudden decision, they planned this a long time ago. But... why?

Well, by acquiring Activision, Blizzard, King and even Bethesda, they got **a massive amount of game that live and have their success on a massive variety of platforms and screens**. Here's the thing: if you are Microsoft, in front of something like this, you have 2 choises:

Option A) you scale down everything to become Xbox/PC exclusive. This for sure make you sell more consoles, yeah, but it also throw away the potential of becoming the biggest publisher out there.

Option B) you use the potential and you expand in that. They have their hands **everywhere**. They are some of the biggest PC publishers, Mobile publishers, heck even **PlayStation and Switch publishers**. 

I fell they saw that and thinked ""yeah, we should expand that, we should go that route""

But what does that mean for the Xbox consoles and gamepass ? Is it bad for them? No, i think quite the opposite. Having a costant, **massive** amount of money coming from literally every possible screen makes the Xbox console and Gamepass have way less weight on their shoulders. Imagine if Cod was Xbox exclusive: Gamepass was going to eat all the sales, meaning that Gamepass was going to be the **only** way for Microsoft to see Money and, because of that, an eventual failure was going to weight way more. 
But now they dont have that problem, sure Cod on Gamepass is going to eat Xbox and some PC Sales, but the game is still going to sell crazy on Playstation and in the future Nintendo console.

Sorry for the wall of text, just my tought. Thank you for reading and what do you think?",35,0
