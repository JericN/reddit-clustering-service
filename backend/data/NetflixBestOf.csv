>!(When I watched the episode where number **8** and **4** got out, I low key thought number **7** went down the **delivery** system to number **4s** floor,freed her and then freed number **8** following which he went down the delivery system from the **8** th floor back into his room to avoid suspicion but that wasn't the case)!<",8,3

1. Sam and Nia seem to be obsessed with their online personas and would rather maintain online popularity than act like actual grown ups and protect their children by removing themselves from social media completely. They would rather continue ignoring the elephant in their lives by creating a mask on social media and sorting out their marriage. The environment they are creating for their kids is beyond me.

2.  I respect religion. But using the religion to hide behind the fact that you’ve made mistakes and in some cases, unforgivable things is a mockery to Christianity. They are taking advantage of faith by saying ""yeah I did this but it’s always okay because God forgives"". Yeah I’m sure God does but cmon? You are trying to justify the fact that you are allowed to do these terrible things because you trust in god? You are basically saying religion is giving you a license to do bad things instead of contributing to doing good. Sam, you cheated on your wife for years and the only reason you are sorry about any of it is because you thought you would never get caught. I recall Sam saying he never wanted Nia to find out about any of this and was going to take his secrets to the grave. And he would’ve only for the exposure of the online site. Where are your morals? 

3. The Ashley Madison Scandal is insane. However, the documentary was shocking. The whole documentary was based on victimizing the people who actually used the site to cheat and made the hackers out to be the people at fault. The whole message was ""yes these people did these bad things but oh, it was the people who released the data that created the problem"". No. The problem started when these married individuals made the conscious decision to sign up to participate in adultery. The documentary was totally biased in creating an idea that it was okay for these people to do what they did. Where were the wives/husbands whose lives were destroyed from these scandals? The multiple suicides from the exposure? I would’ve liked to have seen more of those topics rather pathetic men pretending to cry on screen over their infidelity and chatting shite about how they’ve ""redeemed"" themselves. 

4. These, primarily men basically refused to communicate effectively with their spouses on their needs and wants (don’t get me wrong, women were on this site too.. But the documentary was primarily about men and how they used the site). Instead, they just decided they were going to betray them and cheat on them. ""Marriage is hard"", ""you get bored"", ""I couldnt see myself sleeping with the same person for 20-30 years"" ok? surely you would've known this before you got married.. so why did you make a commitment? Have you ever tried talking to your spouse and having discussions over these subjects? You basically chose not to stand by the person you made lifelong commitments too and instead sought the “easiest” way out. So no you are not the victims of this scandal at all. You’s all got what you deserved. These people are in so much denial, it’s frightening. These men were claiming to love their wives but are somehow able to justify cheating all in the same breath. 


Just my thoughts. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. But this documentary made me absolutely livid.

I usually avoid shows with <2 seasons, I like to get invested but not Gray's Anatomy invested. The one season shows I watched were 13 Commandments and Harper's Island but those are meant to be one season and I liked them, but it was nothing special. I've also watched Rick and Morty and Solar Opposites, but the cartoon style isn't really for me. So yea if you have any cool shows that you watched, please share them with me down below!",59,8

For me, I really like the aspect of Berlin rather than the heist. I really really when he talks in a poetic way and how he Expresses his love.

Other than that the heist aspect can be a bit better as of more can seen from the heist.

Only problem is that there is really a lot sex most it is not need. But maybe it could be a bit low.",0,0

I do love indie movies, I'm a sucker for queer coming-of-age stories with a whimsical vibe, but I'd be down for *anything*, leaning towards the sweeter-less-tragic side. Thanks!!",12,0
