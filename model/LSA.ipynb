that's probably effect weeks now, mtc4 increased premium dolby theatres. i'm pretty sure $3 long ago. $5. there's baseline price increase long ago well. also added service fee booking online tickets year ago that's controversial, challenged canada's competition bureau form drip pricing. interesting, pretty transparent way chain increase revenues, adding box office sharing studios. i'm sure various price increases anticipation drop service fee lose lawsuit. regardless, adds twist comps. big new releases still skew heavily premium formats, probably helps push sales (april 12). initial rush seems over. greatest baseline, we're still really far (april 11). seemed lot better day 2, still nothing huge. i'll probably take time weekend try figure comp strategy (april 10). preview sales
