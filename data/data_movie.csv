They talk about PJ’s behavior obviously but not Josie’s. I don’t know that bothered me a decent sum. I was surprised they didn’t mention it. Josie’s behavior towards Hazel wasn’t as bad or as pointed but it was super dismissive and she she didn’t listen to her or really respect her through the movie. Shrug. 

I also kindaaaaa wish they put more effort into the last final fight scenes to look more believable? like the girls punches / kicks just did not look like solid. I figure that might’ve been part of the charm but for me it took me out a bit. it’s nitpicky 


Overall though it was a super fun watch and it felt like a unique idea. ",0,1

I just want to discuss the perspectives of others.

My favorite film of all time is the 1941 Disney animated film Dumbo. It's a film that means so much to me on an emotional level and is a movie that has gotten me out of a lot of emotional low-points. I'm not here to gush over the movie, since that'd take an hour, I'm here to talk about what everyone's immediate thoughts about the movie are.

The film has two scenes that are seen as highly controversial, and involve issues of race, if that sounds uncomfortable to anyone, don't read beyond here.

The first scene in question is near the beginning of the film where the circus tent is being built, and out from a train car, a group of people come out, sing a work song, and build the tent. Multiple people, admittedly myself, perceived these characters as black people. A lot of people ridicule this scene due to the song in question and the conditions the characters are working in.

The second is near the end of the film, where Dumbo and Timothy (the mouse), at their lowest points in the story, met a group of crows who are 100 percent race-coded as black people. The main criticism these characters get is based solely on they way they act, which people have labeled stereotypical. Furthermore, people have took note that the lead crow character is named ""Jim Crow"" based on his model sheets, which was a term associated with minstrel performances during the 1910s and 1920s.

I personally don't find anything inherently harmful about the crows as characters in the slightest, and I don't even really find the tent building scene that harmful either (as the film shows animals are also forced to work on the tent, and work songs have been a part of African American culture before Dumbo ever released). Maybe I'm ignorant however, I'm not certain, but whenever someone asks me what my favorite movie is, I always either hesitate or just lie, due to how this movie has a track record in most people's minds as ""another Disney movie with racist imagery"".

I'd genuinely like to hear anyone else's perspectives on this.",39,0

Other than mafia films that I grew up on like the Godfather and Goodfellas, or Hitchcock, pre-80s, the style makes me feel claustrophobic in a way. I don't know how to describe it but yeah, I know about the Army of Darkness, I used to see it in stores sometimes.

I always thought the series was a zombie thing? I saw the cover art for Army of Darkness and immediately thought it was based on zombies. What actually is the franchise about? Every movie seems to have a vastly different description, different character, different genre, some of them are comedies, some of them are semi-dark-comedies, some of them aren't comedies at all, some of them are based on the undead, some of them are supernatural.

Is there anyone who can explain what the franchise actually encompasses before I watch Evil Dead Rise (which i've heard is great)?

P.S. I've heard some of the earlier movies are also great, I know Armies of Darkness is a classic but like I said, I guess i'm not a big fan of the oldschool special effects and stuff.

I'm using a pretty lax definition myself so if you have a movie you like and aren't sure the character is a real femme fatale, don't worry and just share it.

My favorite is Margot Robbie from Babylon. She is beautiful, sexy, dangerous, and...disturbed, as you can see in this video (not for the faint of heart).

It's completely unrelated to the first movie Havoc, which was a refreshing surprise since that movie was definitely a hate watch for me. The opening scene of this movie was really cringy and strange, listing out all the rules of this abnormal group of about 6 ""friends"". I didn't have high hopes for it at all starting out, but as the movie went on it really sucked me in. As someone who is always searching for positive polyamorous representation, after about 20 minutes into the movie I was really starting to become hopeful that this was it. I was shocked, poly representation in an adolescent film?? It's unheard of. They show peers at school antagonizing the group, calling them a cult, poking fun at their queerness, and speaking about them behind their back. Strangely, there isn't any actual refutal of this. No mention of actual polyamory or acknowledgment of their polycule as a valid entanglement of relationships. The group does brush off the criticism though and they seem to feel very comfortable in their relationship dynamic, just without actually trying to justify it? I really liked how they portrayed the group as a bunch of smart kids, instead of burn outs. There were some sex scenes but just as many if not more casual scenes where the group is engaging in platonic activities. It was nice to see them represented without hyper sexual stereotyping. All seems to be going well until one of the girls in the group Wendy begins to crush on her new neighbor boy. It becomes this whole ordeal, she tells him shes taken and can't pursue him. Then she proceeds to secretly pursue him. I kept thinking, why not just tell your polycule? Why is there an unspoken rule not to date outside of the group? Eventually one of the other girls in the group Billie sees the two kissing. She later confronts them while a few of them are having sex. Wendy is making out with another male group member and tells him she doesn't want to go further that night, Billie watches from across the room and starts freaking out, trying to force Wendy to have sex with him. All the other group members are like Woah we don't do that here, theres no forcing anything. It nearly turns into a physical altercation before Wendy leaves. Earlier in the film, Billie was seen bullying another girl who previously left the polycule with another boy, so I guess this was supposed to be another example of her ostracizing anyone who leaves. (although I'm still not sure why pursing someone new means you're excommunicated)
Eventually the other group members start to push back on Billie and her behavior. Wendy sees that shes alone and they make up without any mention of the fucked up scene I described before. Theres a lot of plot points directed at monogamous culture being a trap or a fairytale, something that the group members would never want for themselves. It's very all or nothing. Overall, I'm not sure what the takeaway was supposed to be in this film. It felt pretty all over the place, and at the end of the day probably just further added stigma to the polyamorous community.

One of my favourite films of all time is Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and I adore Judge Dredd(comics).

To start, one of the things I love about Judge Dredd is the examination of how an organised dystopian society functions, so I didn't come in expecting the wild west that the later entries were known for.
I watched around 50 mins of this film, so if my opinion is ignorant, please correct me.

To start, the movie didn't seem to have a sense of pace or direction, nor did the plot really compel me to keep watching, Max didn't seem to get much screen time at all and it mostly seemed to focus on the cartoon biker lads who weren't particularly interesting.

I'm coming off as overly critical, because to be honest I couldn't get through the film, thematically it had some interesting stuff going on, but it didn't ever seem to go past surface level. Sci-fi aside there were a few car chases but other than that the part that I watched just seemed vapid and I wasn't feeling at all compelled to continue.

Keep in mind I am not Aussie and have never been to Australia(Brit Here), my views of this film are from a gen z who doesn't understand the cultural impact it had on it's country of origin.

I really wanted to like this, it just didn't click with me, so much so that I couldn't sit through the entire thing(I never really do this).

Instead of rebooting, just continue on, even with a new cast, just keep the canon. That was James Bond after all, and that lasted for 40 years. This thinking started with the James Gunn DCU with Superman: Legacy, later Superman, set for 2025. While I want to see it, it isn't what everybody wanted; sure the DCEU was having issues post-Aquaman, and ZSJL showed people where things could've gone if they stayed on track instead of going nowhere; but many wanted Cavill back, Man of Steel 2, and great stories. Continue the DCEU, not reboot; no wants that for the MCU after a lukewarm Phase 4, after all. Perhaps that's why the box office numbers for the 2023 DCEU films weren't good, post-reboot announcement.

But that's one example. Another is Hellboy; Hellboy 3 is what everyone wanted, but issues the studio and Del Toro led to the reboot that no one wanted, and no one liked at all. In alot of ways, even Spider-Man was like this when Spider-Man 4 was rebooted as Amazing Spider-Man; while it led to a likeable Andrew Garfield version of the character, we all know everyone would dream for a Spider-Man 4 if given the chance.

Now, not all reboots are bad, that includes the ones that came out or will come out, and that includes the next Superman, the next Fantastic Four, Man of Steel, Casino Royale, Star Trek, Batman Begins, and even The Batman, etc. Speaking of two from that list, reboots make sense when done right: it was a new thing back in 2005 with Batman Begins and Casino Royale a year later, because it had to be done after the last entries from each made it hard to follow up on. Plus, the word was new, but we always had new incarnations, versions, since the beginning of film, going back to even Frankenstein for example. But nowadays, especially for franchises, it came get confusing, especially for newcomers. But its not like it can't be cleared up for them, and not like there aren't good reasons to do a reboot, but that's why I'm asking this.

It may be just me, is there such a thing as reboot fatigue?",13,0

If you haven’t already watched it go watch it now… seriously. So basically the whole plot is based around a teenager named Ivan who doesn’t have anything going for him and is basically a complete failure, but he sees a poster by “SplatBang Media” who is offering a large sum of money for someone who streams 24/7 for 100 days. Long story short he blows and his clips get re-posted all over TikTok. In one of these clips it shows him absolutely failing to talk to a girl from his middle school who he likes. The girl then finds out that she was filmed and is angry but then starts to take advantage of Ivan and more specifically is stream to boost her following. In the process of Ivan thinking she really likes him he pushes away his one best friend and eventually breaks up with his girlfriend. He feels like the whole worlds against him and is severely depressed, then while he is just hanging around near what looks to be a pier two girls come up to him and ask him for a photo. He tells them no but they keep pestering them and he explodes, causing one of them to cry. This leads to people finding his home and fixing him as people randomly just go out of their way to torture him and his family. He gets into a confrontation with his parents and eventually runs away into the wild until eventually an employee from the company he was doing the challenge for finds him and after telling him how how him running away would damage the brand so much also informs him that he will not be getting paid and that the contract is terminated which was stipulated by the company from the very beginning. The movie ends when Ivan once again runs away but this time towards a pond and throws his camera into it,  only for the camera to record some muffled talking and the fish in the pond  before starting up again to show a new person signing the same contract that Ivan had repeating the cycle.

It is honestly an amazing movie and deserves so much more attention considering it was made using only a go-pro, a few actors (mostly the YouTubers family and some friends), and one really passionate film maker. I honestly encourage anyone reading this post to watch it, it’s definitely worth it.",0,0

One of my childhood favorites, this Western has it all, the good guys, bad guys, a femme fatale, some great action scenes, and a superb climax.  The movie revolves around the hunt for a gold stash hidden in   ""Cañon del Oro""  , believed to be guarded by Apache spirits. When **Marshall Sam Mckenna(Gregory Peck)** is caught in an ambush by a native Indian Praire Dog and kills him in self defense, he comes across the map containing the treasure.

However an outlaw **John Colorado(Omar Sharif)**, who along with the gang is on the search for the gold, capture McKenna, along with **Inga(Camila Sparv),** daughter of an old judge, forcing him to lead to the location of the gold. Colorado's gang includes his right hand man Sanchez, Apache warrior Hachita, and an Apache woman Hesh-Ke who happens to be McKenna's ex love.

There are also **Ben Baker( Eli Wallach)** a gambler who forces himself into Colorado's gang as well as **Sgt Tibbs( Telly Savalas)**, of the Cavalry.  

The movie is pure popcorn fun, you have some great action scenes, like the one where the gang  is chased by a bunch of Apache Indians, or the final scene. 

This was the movie that inspired George Lucas to make Raiders of the Lost Ark, the scene where Indiana Jones uses the sunlight to find out the Ark's location was inspired by a similiar scene in this. He even made a documentary short **6-18-67** on the making of this movie. Incidentally the movie while a flop in the US, was widely succesful in Soviet Union and India.

Gregory Peck is as reliable as ever, but the scene stealer here is Omar Sharif, who makes one of the most bad ass Westen villians, with his witty one liners, quips. Telly Savalas is suitably nasty as the devious Sgt. Tibbs. 

And yes the Ole Turkey Buzzard song composed by Quincy Jones that occurs throughout the movie.

If you are just looking some good weekend fun, go for this movie.

Rango doesn’t do this, instead of following the popular crowd it gives each character a unique and interesting design, for example the rabbit doctor who is missing an ear, one character has a full on arrow in one of his eyes and it is a permanent part of his appearance, even minor characters like the vulture with a prosthetic leg, all of these designs give them personality and could give us possible backstories, the rabbit doctor is an alcoholic and is missing an ear, perhaps he fought in some battle as a medic and lost an ear, or the vulture had it’s leg crushed under a rock, these designs aren’t as bland and are different in a good way.

Tl;dr - Rango has interesting and very unique designs while most others like Zootopia and Sing have their characters looking symmetrically perfect.

But the one who it was arguably the most important for was Dan Akyroyd in that it arguably saved his career. People may not remember this, but at this point Akyroyd was struggling; not only had he just suffered a big flop with ""Doctor Detroit"", but he was also dealing with the still recent death of John Belushi and people in the industry were questioning if he was viable onscreen without Belushi as his comedic partner (John Landis said they compared it to ""Abbott without Costello"").

His multiple flawed attempts at fraud which all backfire almost immediately (were not a bank, Jerry) coupled with possibly the worst plan in the history of man to stage a ransom that sets off an utterly insane chain of events because this dumbass had no idea what he was actually doing, it turns what in any other tone of a film would be an uncomfortable crime thriller into the blackest of black comedies, all because of sheer incompetence. Even the arguably most competent criminal in the whole film (the mechanic ex con who put Jerry in touch with Carl and Gaer to begin with) still ends up having his relatively minor crime screw up (though to be fair that one wasn’t entirely his fault).

I just now finished this movie just yesterday and I actually really, really liked it. After a long while, I finally watched the first two Patlabor movies directed by Mamori Oshii and lemme tell you, they're both incredibly different from each other.

The first movie is a rather conventional mecha anime about the police trying to stop like a terrorist attack where robots are hacked into and stuff and both the animation and general tone of the film are rather light-hearted despite this particular aspect. It's entertaining and I found myself kinda enjoying much of the drama in it but it's one of those films that I feel doesn't really go to deeply on anything and exists as basically as the futuristic police procedure film with no greater point to the nature about them.

2nd one, on the other hand, is a genuinely very thought provoking and complex political drama on much of the political situation in not just Japan's specific history after the war but also on this idea that there is no such thing as a peaceful time in society and that this peace only exists for those who are privileged enough to not suffer much of the consequences of the wars and interventions performed by those who claim to be upholding peace. Not to mention how it seems to correlate the idea of the police and machinery with the military with this idea that the police are supposedly maintaining law and order in civilized society but in reality, are acting out of fear and paranoia and much of this behavior could lead civil outrages and doubts about the current status quo. It's genuinely a deeply introspective piece of art and I think it's very interesting that Mamori wanted to use this franchise as a way for commenting on all of these heavy subjects because as far I understand how the original series exists, it seems like a fairly normal mecha police series which doesn't really go too deeply on itself about what are the implications to this future about the police and also, how this basically implies that the police are essentially using weapons of great destructive energy just to catch some criminals in the city when these should be existing for the use of this big war where civilians shouldn't be around for their lives to be at risk. One interesting scene is when they take down like one of those balloon ships and they fuck up by shooting at it in a way where it crashes on the city ithat leads to unnecessary harm and as a result, releases this gas which covers all of Shinjuku but later, it turns out to be fake and not actual biological warfare being exposed to the population. I thought it was a very great form of storytelling to express how the police and military in their desperation to target and take down this enemy, they only end up causing even greater damage that would rightfully get them heavily criticized and lose forever the trust of the public if it turned out that they're responsible for essentially killing everyone for not being more careful about how they handle these situations. I also love the final scene where the female officer is about the handcuff the terrorist behind this false war. Instead of using it to handcuff both his hands, she handcuff herself along with him, which I think symbolically implies that yes, she is also culpable and that they're indeed both fighting within an illusion of war and peace. 

Honestly, these are the kind of criticisms I would sort of imagine for a story being told by an American film with them being the greatest military power in the entire planet and having a disturbing history of interventionism which would cause so much damage to many countries which would last for a long time as they kept pretending to be a nation of liberty, equality and happiness as its title of honor. Surprisingly a radical and critical work to the nature of militarism and foreign involvements but it's told very intelligently and with such maturity that you almost never see with a lot of anime films.

I could honestly rewatch it again. I think the whole political drama and expositions are incredibly engaging and interesting and the animation+cinematography is beautiful and atmospheric. I also thought it was a very interesting choice that it pays very little attention to the main characters who basically do all of the robot fighting and there's so few moments with the mechas being shown in action in nearly 2 hours. In this narratuve, it''s more about the behind-the-scenes talks which occur in context of these missions. In a way, it seems to kind of deglorified mechas as a popular appeal we often like to see with anime to get across the point that their creation exists in the inherent context of war and they should be aknowledged for the complicated politics behind such weapons.

While it may not be my absolute favorite by Mamori Oshii, this is certainly the 2nd best film I've seen from him so far just behind ""Angel's Egg"" and definitely above ""Ghost In The Shell"" in my opinion.",9,40

","My wife and I recently watched the Andy Serkis series, and really enjoyed it a lot. So last night we were like, ""let's try this one, how bad can it be?"" And I gotta tell you..it was *bad*.

The cast is stacked, the budget was huge, and Tim Burton was still talented. So what happened? What happened is that the studio apparently forced them to rush the movie for a release date, causing a seemingly first-draft script to end up on the big screen. *Everything* important to know about the world, the characters, their motivations, etc is simply ""told"" to us through forced, unnatural, expository dialog. Once I noticed it in the dinner scene early on, I couldn't stop noticing it. It was an absolute train wreck of a script. 

For example:

The aforementioned dinner scene, where all the apes are having an argument seemingly for the first time, so that the audience can get filled in on the debate points, even though these characters have clearly been having this discussion for years. The movie was incapable of *showing* us all these viewpoints, so it simply *told* us.

When the bad general ape says to his gorilla right-hand man, ""you're not just a soldier, you're my friend,"" it was like ok the movie is incapable of *showing* us their friendship, so it simply *told* us.

When the horde of humans shows up at the sacred spaceship, a character tells Marky Mark, ""they've heard the stories of the human who defied the apes, and had to see it for themselves."" The movie was incapable of *showing* us how these humans heard the story and traveled en masse to this site, so it simply *told* us (this is especially egregious because of the logistical improbability of the scenario. He started defying the apes like 2 days ago, in secret, clear in the other direction. How could they all have possibly heard this story? Where? From whom? Unclear, and the script didn't care).

It goes on and on. It literally seemed like they accidentally filmed the first draft of the script, before it was refined at all. And well...according to Tim and some of the actors, that's basically what happened...and not on accident. Just a travesty.

But there are a lot of movies having to do with robots so I'd be interested to hear which ones you guys like the most.

Btw, what I really liked about the second movie in particular was how good Schwarzenegger and  Patrick were. There were two levels to this: At the level of the movie's world, you were in awe of robots that were looking so human. At the level of actual reality, you were in awe of great acting and the amazing CGI that helped suspend your disbelief and imagine you were watching robots. I mean Patrick running after the car was phenomenal. And remember, Terminator 2 was made over 30 years ago, so you can only imagine how amazing it was at the time if you saw it in the theaters.",35,0

I had an experience with it that I don’t think I’d had with any other movie: For a while, I presumed the leads would end up together. They were strongly attracted to each other and made phenomenal music together, so of course they were the best possible match for each other, right? And when it started looking like they wouldn’t, I felt disappointed. But at the end, when I saw “the Girl” reunited with her husband, and the whole family together in the apartment, it felt right. Not like she was settling for a loveless relationship for her daughter’s sake but like she thought she had probably given up too hastily before and there was potential for it to become a more loving relationship.

So are there other romances like this where the leads don’t end up together and it’s possibly the better outcome for everyone, versus some tragic trade-off?

At multiple points in the movie we hear drums in the background when there isn’t any music playing to signify his passion or thoughts about drumming. After he gets kicked out and gets fletcher fired there’s a scene where he’s walking on a busy street and  then it cuts to him on the couch. I swear while he’s on the street and when the camera pans over to him on the couch very very very faint drums are playing in the background. I’m pretty sure the same drum’s mixed in with the clapping when he first gets on stage with fletcher for his show at the end of the movie. Please lmk ,3,0

In the movie a doctor/adventurer relays the tale of his most recent exploits.  Dr. Yuen Chen-hsieh visited Thailand a year earlier &amp; ran afoul of a Dark Sorcerer that placed a blood curse on him.

Chow Yun-fat gets top billing but don't get fooled as it's a glorified cameo. The film doesn't suffer though from his lack of presence. The plot makes sense even though it contains a fair amount of mystical mumbo-jumbo. It mostly careens from one action set piece to another.

You have a hostage shootout with the cops, a monk battle, a skeleton fight, a demon fight &amp; so much more. As I mentioned in the subject there's some nasty practical effects. The initial outbreak of the Dr's blood curse complete with pulsating veins is well done. There's also a nifty demon transformation scene &amp; the sorcerer controls a nasty little monster he throws at people.

I honestly can't recommend this movie enough. At one point the Dr. tries to flying elbow drop a demon. The movie is available free with ads on Tubi. It's edited to some extent but I'm not sure what all is cut. The best fully uncut release is the Region B Blu-ray from 88 Fims.

I have developed a curriculum that will require students to watch a minimum of 16 feature films over the course of the semester, including 8 that we will watch together in class. For the other 8, I'm giving them a list of films to pick from to watch at home. I'll also host after school screenings in case some students don't have the capacity to watch the films at home (and work with students who need other opportunities, of course). 


The units I've selected:


Screenplay Writing

Acting

Production Design

Cinematography

Editing

Sound and Music

Animation

Documentaries



I've compiled a list of movies that I think is really great! Unfortunately, like anyone, I'm prone to biases and blind spots. As I look over my films, I notice that I'm low on: 

-Films between 1960 and 1989

-Films before 1949

-Films by women and people of color

-Movies not in English


Additionally, my list is very Oscar-Centric because those are the movies I tend to enjoy. 


I am hoping to compile a watchlist of movies that is outside of my norm, hoping that many of them can make it onto the list and, even perhaps, into the core group of films I show. Obviously, because I'm working with high schoolers, I can't show anything R-Rated (I can put it on the extension list and require a parent permission form, however). 


Can y'all help me make a summer watchlist of movies that might fill in some of my gaps? Bonus points if you can tell me what unit the movies might fall into. ",16,0

as you probably know, there are countless films and series that show the viewer that greed and striving for power are something negative. These films often promote qualities such as modesty, compassion, etc.  

This isn't necessarily ""wrong"", but I've been looking (unsuccessfully) for films that approach this topic in a more thoughtful way. Films that perhaps also clearly show the disadvantages of altruistic behavior. Or emphasize that to some extent selfish behavior and the pursuit of power are not wrong or even necessary in order to live happily or make others happy.  

As I said, I haven't found a single film whose message at the end doesn't say ""Greed is evil, modesty is good."" Do you have any suggestions?

I’m hoping for answers that you won’t find on Google through a surface-level buzzfeed article. I’d love answers that aren’t so common, from people that actually have a passion for cinema. Valid common answers are still welcome for discussion though!

For example; some people say Manchester by the Sea leaves them feeling empty due to the realistic portrayal of grief and shame (this one’s more common, but valid). Below are a small list of movies that I just couldn’t shake out of my head:

-Insterstellar
-The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 
-Pearl
-Dream Scenario
-Honey Boy
-The Royal Tenenbaums 
-Speak No Evil
-Synecdoche, New York
-Uncut Gems
-Midsommar
-The Lobster
-The Witch
-When Marnie was There
-Perfect Blue

As someone who's only seen one other Wes Anderson film (Moonrise Kingdom) I can't comment on how his style holds up across his entire filmography, but I really think that it works exceptionally well here, adding to the story on display rather than detracting from it. The movie's tone is proudly odd and yet often earnest, and that mix feels perfectly emphasised by Anderson's unique directorial style.

The whole cast is good, but Ralph Fiennes gets the showcase role and makes the absolute most of it here, spitting out the rapid-fire dialogue with really sharp comedic timing, and his performance lines up perfectly with the film's occasionally grim humor.

I went into this one not quite sure what to expect of it, but it left me so thoroughly entertained across its runtime that it really surprised me, and it closed on a note that hit me far deeper emotionally than I would've ever guessed that it would.

Not to mention the burgeoning romances between 2 of the pairs that form near the end of the movie. Do you they start dating? Does everyone become friends and hang out going forward? Do they go back to before and ignore each other? 

Personally I think it’s somewhere in between. I think they probably say hi to each other if they pass in the hall. If they are in a class together they might sit near each other, or work together if they need a partner on a project. I doubt they become bonafide friends though. Also doubt either of the “couples” actually start dating.

&gt;*Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes* proves, without a doubt, that there is still life on this *Planet* with plenty room to grow. I am psyched for the next one. 

[Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-wes-ball-owen-teague-1235890518/) (80):

&gt;Josh Friedman’s smart screenplay takes its cue from its recent predecessors in reflecting the politics of its time. But the movie works equally well as pure popcorn entertainment, packing its two-and-a-half-hour running time with nail-biting thrills but also allowing sufficient breathing space to build depth in the characters and story.

[Variety](https://variety.com/2024/film/reviews/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-1235993963/) (70):

&gt;“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” invites us to embrace the drama of apes fighting apes. By the end, though, in what is in effect a teaser for the next sequel, it looks as if the franchise’s blowhard version of the human race will be back after all. That could be enough to make you want to escape from the planet of the apes.

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/movies/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review.html) (80):

&gt;It probes how the act of co-opting idealisms and converting them to dogmas has occurred many times over. What’s more, it points directly at the immense danger of romanticizing the past, imagining that if we could only reclaim and reframe and resurrect history, our present problems would be solved.

&gt;This is a far cry from the thrill-a-minute blockbuster that its early “summer” release date might lead you to expect (if the “Apes” franchise has always unfolded at a different register from the rest of its multiplex competition, that difference has never been more pronounced than it is here), and the pathos simply doesn’t run as deep as it did by the end of Reeves’ trilogy, but the final moments of Ball’s film make it easy to imagine that its sequels could reach similar dramatic heights. That’s ominous news for this franchise’s latest generation of characters, but heartening information for anyone who can appreciate the cognitive dissonance of a “Planet of the Apes” movie that leaves you with a renewed sense of hope for tomorrow.

[Paste Magazine](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/planet-of-the-apes/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review) (7/10):

&gt;Despite its deficiencies, *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* possesses enough of its own intriguing trajectory for Ball’s new stab at the franchise to have the opportunity to grow into its own singular new strand within the *Apes* canon. After 55 years of different directions, this is far from the most exciting *Planet of the Apes* has been, but it’s also far from the worst, and I’m open to seeing wherever this leads.

[SlashFilm](https://slashfilm.com/1577970/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/) (8/10):

&gt;Previously, Ball has only directed three ""Maze Runner"" films, each of the artifacts from the '00s and '10s Y.A. dystopian trend. The ""Maze Runner"" movies were based on a nonsensical conceit — teens are memory-wiped and then locked into a moving maze populated by monsters (??) — and Ball, for whatever slick effects and sexy young actors who could throw in, couldn't quite salvage the material. Here, Ball seems more assured, letting his $165 million franchise picture contain scenes of walking, of rest, and of quiet. After a decade of hyperactive action and nerdy mythos construction, the quiet moments are appreciated. 

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/may/08/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-future-simians-swing-through-cinematic-jungle) (60):

&gt;The film becomes rather jumbled and preposterous by the very end, but not before some perfectly good action sequences, and the CGI ape faces are very good. This franchise has held up an awful lot better than others; now it should evolve to something new.

[Total Film](https://www.gamesradar.com/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/) (3/5):

&gt;Alas, try as he might, Teague just isn’t as compelling as Serkis in a sequel that exhibits little of the Rise/Dawn/War triptych’s grand thematic sweep. And while the film’s striking vision of a California overtaken by foliage never fails to dazzle, particularly in scenes where Noa and orangutan Raka (Peter Macon) explore what was once LAX, there’s not enough that’s fresh here to make you salivate for the future instalments its ending invites.

[ScreenRant](https://screenrant.com/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-movie-review/)(80):

&gt;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a rousing action-adventure in the ruins of the human world – traces of the past remain but this is Noa's story.

[Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review-wes-ball/) (50)

&gt;By the time the demands of big-budget spectacle take over in the final act, a film that initially stands out from the pack in imagining a different perspective of the world ends up looking all too disappointingly like everything else in the current mega-budget cinema landscape.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/):

&gt;Perhaps I shouldn’t be too surprised that the first “Apes” movie released under Disney ownership is empty franchise gruel that thinks all audiences want is a bunch of CGI coupled with a recognizable IP. That approach has worked out for the studio in the past, and maybe people will happily embrace whatever this is. But it’s certainly not a movie worthy of the “Planet of the Apes” moniker.

[Collider](https://collider.com/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/) (70)

&gt;Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes explores the past while creating a new future, starting this fresh angle on the series to a rocky, but promising start.

Completely changed my mind about this movie.,"So I had watched it twice in the past, quite some time ago. I always recognized it was a good movie, but I never *liked* it that much. I found it to be slow and boring (while still recognizing it was a good movie, just one I did not really enjoy). Both times I had watched it, I paused mid-movie because it was so slow and felt like I would rather do something else.

I rewatched it again last night, without having ever changed my opinion on the movie. And wow, what a complete turnaround. I don't know if it's because I am mature enough now to truly appreciate it, or because the conditions to watch the movie were perfect (nice TV, alone at night, peaceful surroundings), but wow. I loved it. I don't know how I had missed how perfect the intro was and set the tone for the movie perfectly. All the details about the Italian-American world through Connie's wedding is perfect world-building. The moment in Sicily, so beautiful... and the final scene. Just wow. Michael lying to Kay's face and the music starting right that second, only to end when that mobster closes the door while Kay watches in despair/disbelief.   
  
Regarding the score, I had always enjoyed it, but again, for some reason last night was the first time I realized how amazingly it fitted in the film. Just a few themes which come back regularly and are rearranged, but it always or almost always works really well.

Maybe I had never watched it in a good setting. Maybe I was not old enough to truly appreciate it back when I watched it. I don't know. But wow did my mind change last night like it never did for any movie before. It truly is an excellent film.",278,614

They all feel like they have his heart and soul poured into them. Jack Black is great, but he seems slightly out of place, but it doesn’t get in the way too much. Some of his lines have genius timing. I also love the celebration of smalltown New Jersey and the love for historic buildings.

I used to think they were just direct sequels with no time jump, but there's like 800 years between them. 

1. Is there any relevance to nova and Cornelius in war and also planet? At first I thought they were the same, but then the time skip happens. So what's the point of it? Just a cute nod by the director to the original movie or is there some actual connection?

2. Why didn't nova in war talk? Did it have something to do with why planet humans don't talk or is that again, just an easter egg type thing?

3. When did Taylor and Brent leave earth? Based on the rapid decline of society after rise, I imagine they left before that movie?

4. Is the lawgiver supposed to be someone in the prequel movies like Caesar or Cornelius?

5. Is the upcoming movie bridging the gap between war and planet, or is it part of a trilogy that will bridge it, or is there still going to be gaps?

6. Lol what is the deal with the ending of beneath the planet of the apes? How did people react to that when the movie released?

However, I found out later, regretfully, that the skinhead's wife and children moved to Canada, from the witness protection programme, to get away from him.  It's been inferred that the skinhead went back to his old ways - unfortunately.

I also enjoyed Michelle Yeoh as Burmese stateswoman, Aung San Suu Kyi, in ""The Lady"", released in 2011 - a film about her fighting for democracy against the military dictatorship.  She eventually became a limited-power leader for the country.

Regretfully came the Myanmar genocide of Rohingya Muslims and refugees in 2017, under her watch.  Now I can no longer see the politician in a better light because of events after her biopic.

I think we're better off waiting for the person to die, so we can get the whole picture before making any movies about them.

The summary of the movie is that it follows a mother and daughter (Seo-Yeon) with a strained relationship  who move into a house only for the daughter to get random calls from a mysterious woman (Young-Sook)who talks to her as if they know each other. Eventually the two figure out that they're both actually calling from the same house but different time periods, where Seo Yeon is from the present day while Young Sook is from 1992. Another thing to note is that the Young Sook also has a strained relationship with her mother but the difference is that her mother is an abusive shaman who keeps her isolated, and mentally damaged. Seo Yeon and Young Sook get to know each other, they share their traumas such as Seo Yeons father being burned and killed in a house fire and Young Sook revealing that her mother isn't even her mother at all but a woman who assumed custody of her due to her parents unfortunate demise. This is where it gets interesting, since Young Sook is from a time where Seo Yeons father is still alive, they both realise that they can actually work together to change the timeline in which they live, and so in respect to the new found friendship, Young Sook decides to save Seo Yeons father and thus the timeline in which Seo Yeon lives has changed to where her father has been brought back as if he had never died in the first place and the house that she lives in changes from a decrepit, run down mess to a very beautiful and well kept living space, that's how it woukd have been had her father not died in the first place. Young Sook gets jealous over how busy Seo Yeon has become, which leads Young Sook to turn bitter and cold. The movie continues as a thriller showing Young Sooks vengeful and downright disturbing change of character and Seo Yeons desperate attempts at survival using sheer wit against this invisible force which is Young Sook.

Honestly, I find Korean movies and shows to always be super creative and fun to watch, this was no exception at all, in fact this is a highly creative masterpiece which feels like a gulp of cold water after brushing your teeth, I get that kind of refreshment from it. The acting is wonderful, it's almost realistic and visceral, it makes the audience more immersed because we can plausibly see ourselves in the scenario. Young Sooks evil is shown in her uncaring face long before its heard in her words. The concept of the past and future versions of each other being used as collateral by one another creates this really clever aura of helplessness, because we truly can't escape our past, only our future but the past leads to the future and thus they're equally important, the movie balances the equal importance out so perfectly too.

Usually in movies the physical presence of a slasher is what makes the audience feel uneasy and helpless, because the slasher is usually shown to be a force to be reckoned with, this movie is a bit different because the slasher isn't actually there, she's an invisible force, a woman with severe moral impairments, but this is why she's so dangerous , the ball is in her court.

I loved this movie a lot, one of my all time favourites and I highly recommend it

Plot:

In the shadow of New York City's skyscrapers, former SWAT team leader Thomas ""Tommy"" Kane, played by a significantly bulkier Steven Seagal, has settled into a quiet life as a private security consultant. However, his quiet life is disrupted when a high-stakes robbery goes wrong in Midtown Manhattan, and a witness to the crime seeks his protection, fearing for her life.

Tommy, with his vast experience and imposing presence, is thrust back into the danger he thought he'd left behind. The witness, a young art dealer named Emily, holds the key to unlocking a conspiracy that involves a notorious crime syndicate and potentially some members of the city's elite. As Tommy delves deeper into the case, he discovers that the robbery is just the surface of a much larger scheme involving money laundering and high-value art theft. She is housed in his basement which he visits every once a while experiencing some intimate moments despite age differences.

Navigating through the bustling streets and dark alleys of New York during the day time, Tommy uses his old contacts and some unconventional methods to unravel the conspiracy. His inquiries lead him into confrontations with various thugs and hitmen, where his size and strength play a pivotal role in disarming and dispatching his opponents.

The climax of the movie sees Tommy and Emily trapped in a showdown at a gala in an upscale art museum, where the mastermind behind the conspiracy reveals himself as a non binary gangster. In a tense and explosive finale, Tommy must use all his skills to protect Emily, neutralize the threat, and ensure that justice prevails.

The movie ends with Tommy considering a permanent return to law enforcement, inspired by the adrenaline and fulfillment he experienced even though he has a severe heart condition due to obesity. ",17,0

The second Musketeers film had a huge box office drop in France and was criticized for changes to the story.

The film has two directors and screenwriters, Alexandre de La Patellière and Matthieu Delaporte. And Alexandre de La Patellière's father, Denys de La Patellière, was the director of the 1979 miniseries The Count of Monte Cristo with Jacques Weber, which is considered in France to be the best adaptation of the book. The French hope that the film will be more faithful to the book, as was the miniseries by Alexandre de La Patellière's father. 

The French criticize the adaptation with Jim Caviezel, which was a box office failure in France, and the 1998 adaptation.

They don't want the Count returning to Mercedes, but him staying with Princess Haydee. And to make matters worse, French TV will show the 1979 miniseries, from May 12th until June 2nd. Just before the film goes to theaters, they will show the 1979 miniseries and the film will suffer comparisons.",13,0

Bowfinger has some truly excellent comedic moments and is pretty much just straightforward Murphy + Martin,  you know what you're getting and it delivers. It's not top 5 by any means for either actor, but I love it and I want people to know about chubby rain. I feel like people gave up on Martin after like, what, Father of the Bride? He definitely gave us some stinkers, but Bowfinger is great and now he's back in our lives with Only Murders in the Building which people seem to adore (myself included). Feel like Murphy had a similar drop off after Nutty Professor and then did a string of voice work to stay relevant. Bowfinger happened not too long after both of those so I wonder if that's a factor. 

Patriot is weird because for anyone who's watched, it's revered and likely holds a special place in their little TV heart. But for some reason, outside of reddit, I don't know anyone who's seen it. It was cut short and honestly got a little weird in S2. I try recommending it pretty regularly and I make sure to mention that ""it's got the funny guy from S1 of For All Mankind"" which they loved, but won't take my word for Patriot and it makes me more mad than it probably should.

After looking at the list of best picture winners and nominees back to 1928, I realized I had seen very few of them. After renting a few of the early winners, I decided to keep going and watch the whole list. I watched them in a completely random order, first so I wouldn’t disadvantage the early years, and second because I was dependent upon the library.  I paid very little to do this and requested almost all of them through the Columbus Library. It took about 6 months to complete.

These are my rankings. I initially used tiers for categories before I started to individually rank. These are my opinions, and I would not change many of them by more than a few positions.

I am considering a few other lists to spin off from this, like less popular hidden gems or movies that should have won. One thing that shocked me was how often subjects that I considered modern issues came up in these older movies. For example: addiction in The Lost Weekend, Antisemitism in Gentlemen’s Agreement, Indigenous discrimination in Cimmaron, and political intimidation riots in All The King’s Men (gave me Jan 6 flashbacks). Somethings were poorly portrayed, and there is obviously rampant racism in some movies, but overall, it gave me a greater respect for American cinema and overall movie history.

Update 1: I appreciate all the comments, good and bad. I didn't expect this much of a response so it was exciting to see. The only things I disagree with are the comments saying never to watch certain things. This is all art, it's meant to be viewed, good or bad.

I tried to fix the weird formatting, the original draft definitely did not look like that, so I was surprised after I submitted.  

There are a couple movies I want to go back and watch again; Ordinary People, Amadeus, Forest Gump, and On The Waterfront.  Maybe I missed something with these and need to look again. I still think Oppenheimer was a great movie, and Nomadland wasn't.  Not budging on these ones.

I have nothing against Moonlight, it was heartbreaking to watch the loneliness that kept following him every step.  I just didn't like the ending and was hoping for something more definitive and it seemed anticlimactic to me.",646,768

Then that same creepy student and an old lady stare down Cameron Diaz and her husband at the rehearsal dinner.  This movie sucked me in despite the weird script.

It must be how I was brought up but I’ve always been taught to spread your valuables (cash/jewelry) out around the house so if someone breaks in the chance of them finding everything is slim. 

Why did she keep all the cash in one bag? Why didn’t she keep some in the car, some under the bed, some in her bag, some in the fridge etc?

Did he truly love his wife? ,"Hey guys, I've been reading different articles about the movie ""Demolition."" But I don't think Karen and her son really help David reconnect with the world or deal with his loss.

I believe David didn't love his wife fully, which led to him neglecting simple tasks like fixing the refrigerator. His wife called him inattentive. When she passed away, he didn't feel overwhelming grief, just occasional bouts of loneliness, triggered by sudden memories of her. But when he found out about her infidelity and abortion, he didn't feel much guilt for not loving her enough. Instead, he cried, allowing himself to process his emotions in a more traditional way.

The destruction of the objects around him appeared to be a defensive mechanism, shielding him from admitting that he doesn't care about his wife's death. Instead, he metaphorically wants to break himself apart look inside, and understand why he is not broken with her death. 

As for Karen and her son, their encounters with David seemed coincidental. They were just brief interactions, showing glimpses into David's mental state, rather than profoundly impacting his emotional journey or reconnecting him with the world.

Like, to the point they got the exact measurements and proportions from his 1984 physique. They built the molds, hand-painted them, punched in full heads of hair...and the prop(s) itself is on-screen for maybe a minute in total. 

  
Another one that came to mind was Olivia Munn as Psylocke in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"". She prepped for months, doing 6-7 hours of martial arts and sword training a day...and her character does f\*ck all in the movie. It's a shame because she looked great in it and probably could have really done some cool things if they let her shine, but the amount of work she put in is wild.

I didn't hear much buzz about it on its release and I'd heard even less over the years that followed, which led me to go into it thinking I was in for one of Netflix's lesser originals, something bland and unremarkable, but instead I got a bloody and compelling historical war film.

The action in particular is definitely one of the things that I was most impressed with, because they do a great job of giving the hits a sense of weight and impact, and most of it is filmed very nicely (aside from the frantic moments where battle becomes a blur, though that felt purposeful and infrequent enough that I didn't see it as an issue)

The cinematography in general is very handsome, as is the set design and the exceptional costume work. Beyond those surface elements though, I felt that the movie really committed to a grim tone, and it emphasized that with some effectively unsettling scenes, including one moment in particular that made me wince in a way that I don't often do.

It still has its flaws; the ending especially didn't quite give me everything that I wanted from it, but overall, I felt like this movie had enough sharp filmmaking craft and narrative bite to make it absolutely worthwhile if you're looking for something gripping to watch.

(I was not deeply acquainted with the true story that the film was based on when I went into it, so I can't comment on its historical accuracy; as is the case with most ""Based On A True Story"" films, I'd recommend taking it on its own terms rather than treating it as a factual document of history, but I can understand how those things chafe harder when you are more aware of the truth surrounding something like this.)",50,163

This is usually played for comedy.

This trope has gotten a bit of a negative connotation as of late, especially in Marvel Movies, but I feel like when it's done well it can lead to some of the funniest and most memorable moments in a film.

As an example, one of my favorite movies is Rango (2011). After the bank has been robbed, Rango rounds up a posse to hunt down the robbers in question. They mount up, the music swells and Rango proudly proclaims ""Now.... We Ride""! Cut to them riding through the desert on the backs of Road Runners (acting as horses in this world). As they ride one of the posse members pulls up to Rango and asks ""Where are we going?""

Cut to Rango and Co returning to town embarrassed and the mariachi owl band looking on like ""wtf?""

It's honestly one of my favorite jokes in the whole movie, and a great example of bathos done well.

Heck even in the MCU there are good examples of bathos, like in Iron Man 3 when Tony Stark is escaping from captivity, he aims a gun at a henchman and said henchman just throws up his hands and says ""Honestly I hate working here they are so weird.""

I thought it was a movie about a group of people who meet for breakfast. Maybe it’s a rom-com about a bunch of friends who bond over pancakes and coffee. Nope. 

The movie is actually about five high school students from different cliques who spend a Saturday in detention together! How could the title connect the content of the movie. 

I’ll miss it if I just read its name. Thanks for the recommendation. 

What I love the most about the movie is its relatability. We’ve all been there- feeling like we don’t fit in and stuck in a certain role. But even the most unlikely people can find common ground and become friends. 

It reminds of my time in high school. Great. 

So what are your favourite movies with misleading names? I want to know more about them. Thank you in advance.

I saw Hot Stuff from 1979 with Dom Deluise getting into gun fights and running from explosions. Was quite surreal, obviously still done for laughs but he ""has a go."" A new action star was not born overnight, but it got me thinking of movie stars who had a go at something they really would not be known for.

  
Steve Guttenberg doing Airborne and Overdrive. Normally a clean cut comedy star but had a, pretty unsuccessful, go at action.

  
Steve Martin in Novocaine, bit like Guttenberg, the climax of Novocaine is a little more action orientated than I would normally expect from Martin.

  
Roger Moore, no stranger to comedy, but going full slapstick in The Curse of the Pink Panther raised an eyebrow.

  
Harrison Ford's role in What Lies Beneath was a great twist to the movie as you would never expect Ford to go villianous.

Richard Dreyfus in Stakeout was an eye opener, doing what you would expect Mel Gibson to be doing.",329,259

But Remember that Michael's path is supposed to be different from the other sons. They were supposed to become crime lords, so the military is a useless risk


But Michael? Serving in WW2 is almost essential for establishing political legitimacy, especially as an non WASP at the time. Him being a decorated veteran would help him become a Senator/Governor like Vito wanted.


Even elites sometimes send their sons to war. John F. Kennedy served in WW2, and got elected to Congress in 1947. So it never made sense to me that Vito wouldn't realize Michael's path to the White House potentially as through that military uniform

I think maybe the makeup just made him look too much like himself and not enough like fucking Hellboy. I did love every way Harbour was able to show emotion as Hellboy without a “face that talks”

The open scene when he just fucking impales his friend on accident dude that hurts. But also how he accidentally breaks his phone screen trying to hang up but casually pets a dog as he’s walking up.

I just like Ian McShane say lot of word but good.

Holy fuck the betrayal scene and giant fight someone try and tell me what’s wrong with anything here. Hellboy with the giant sword reminded me of a 99 str Elden Ring build. 

“Welcome back to the land of the living” immediately just shit on any hype. This trope is everywhere. 

Jabberwock was a cool reference though beware. Her characters pretty cool just like some lines written by someone who has no clue made it a bit messy. 

“Normalize? Good luck with that” immediately brought me back, I loved this interaction between Harbour and Daniel Dae Kim. lol “I can’t wait till you smell demon shit” is an awful visualization haha.

The whole sequence of her getting that psychic blast and them entering the home with all the dead people. Felt very resident evil silent hill. 

Seance was cool too but the fuck that cgi was so awkward lol, there were so many better ways they could have represented that ladies spirit. Like lol Uhoh spooky ethereal wormlady prophesies doom.

Nimue channeled that Galadriel like she was tempted by the ring herself. 

Dude him using iron on that baby was fucking crazy any mythology fan would love the changeling scene. 

Hellboy has government ID? haha cool

I could keep going lol, Hellboy deserves another another another and another movie.

Who East according to Me the version​ more successful with bias​​ very classic And theatrical . But our project was not nor to stick perfectly At novel , which is 1000 pages , nor to produce yet another adaptation of the Count of Monte Cristo.

**The escape scene​ of yew castle​ East moon of the scenes headlights of movie . Has she claimed lots of training?**

**Pierre:** I admit that the scenes In THE tunnels long And narrow were particularly anxiety-provoking . The claustrophobia was felt quickly feel. For This Who is from the escape scene​ In there Wed , it was filmed in​ this immense basin of which I spoke to you . I never seen that in my life , I even have do A post on THE networks social . It was impressive .

**According to you , what East there singularity of this this project ?**

**Pierre:** We wanted to create A object artistic of almost 2h50 relaxing on a form of modernity And in playing with there transformation physical of character .

In the beginning of the movie, we see Felix (had to look that up), who we later learn had just pulled off a robbery with his brother and another accomplice, hide the money under the floorboards in his room. He then waits for a bit, before getting a knock at the door, he opens it, and clearly recognizes and trusts whoever it is. That person kills him.

So who the hell was that, and why did he kill him?

My first thought would be either his brother or the other guy, but if that was the case, they would have stolen the money. We know his brother, Dock, knew where the money was, so if he was gonna betray him, he would’ve taken the money right?

So maybe it was the other guy? But that would have to mean that he didn’t know where the money was, which seems unlikely. Surely if he didn’t know, he would have waited until he did, then killed Felix.

So maybe it was one of the shady motel people? But then what’s the motive. Clearly not robbery. Besides, what are the odds that Felix knew and trusted one of those guys?

Maybe I missed some shit, it’s been a while since I saw it, and only saw it once. What do you guys think? Do you have an answer? Or otherwise, do you have a solid theory?",11,2

I came across a movie that, from what I can remember, seemed to take place in/around the 50s (think American Graffiti or Porkys). It seemed to be in the teen sex comedy genre, that was so popular in those days (again, think Porkys). Ok, so boy and girl are in the back seat of the car, getting ready for some prime making out (I believe the viewpoint we have as the audience, was from outside of the car, to the side, looking mainly at the rear door and window. I don’t think you really saw them in this moment, leaving you to just hear what they’re saying and letting your imagination run with it). As they get going, you hear her say something like, “But it’s so small!?”, to which he replies, “That’s my thumb!” 😂  Cracked me up as a kid, but I either never caught the name of the movie, or could never remember what it was called. Have wanted to actually watch the damned movie for decades, but all of my attempts to figure out which movie it was, has utterly Failed! 😢 So, it continues to haunt me, and I continue to want to see it, if only to see that scene again and/or at least know what it was called! 😂😅  PLEASE, if you know the movie m referring, PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW!! 🤣🤣🤣

I teaching acting and am looking for funny scenes as we are in our slapstick unit. Funny knock outs, faints, eyes crossing, etc. would be awesome. I already know the three stooges and laurel and hardy, but any specific movies, or even better, scenes, would be awesome.

Jackie Chan has a great fight scene with Brad Allen in ""Gorgeous"" where both walk away crosseyed, this is an awesome example of what I am looking for...

Or in Weekend at Bernies II when Andrew McCarthy passes out when he is pricked with a needle.

I am really curious to find examples of films where talented actors play a character that is bad at acting, the more convincing the better! Ideally one that fooled you into thinking the actor was just phoning it in at first. 

I have been thinking about this, as I would like to know if these kind of roles are particularly challenging for an actor, especially where they have to stay on just the right side of 'bad' to avoid slipping into parody. 

I can't think of any movies myself, but know I have seen some. The only example that comes to mind for me was the TV series 'Avenue 5' where a well known actor puts on a performance so jarringly bad, losing his accent in the middle of a scene to the extent it made me cringe, only for it to be revealed that it was all part of a con. It has really stuck with me!

I'm really interested in any other examples you have, as I'd like to watch some! Edit: bonus points for non-comedy roles if you can think of any!

It was a wonderfully entertaining movie with a fantastic script, but the general takeaway sort of bothered me. I can’t tell if I just misunderstood it though, so I’m coming to you experts for help! 

Here’s what I took away from it: It seems like the lesson Tracy is supposed to be learning is that everyone has flaws, including herself, and she can’t just be forgiving of her own flaws while judging everyone else harshly for theirs. Do I have that right? 

But it seems like the flaws she judges the men for having are pretty serious flaws…her dad cheating on her mom, her husband drinking far too much. There was that one moment where it felt like her dad was literally blaming her for his cheating on her mother?

It felt a bit like the overall message was that women should just put up with these shitty things their husbands do because that’s how men are and you can’t expect them to be perfect.

Man, I was hooked to that movie and to this day it's still one of my favourite movies to watch from time and time again. 

  
Lately I had to study a lot for University and get my productivity going. So I started out with pomodoro method (25 - 5) and doing my seshs, which was insanely boring. Some thinking brought me back to my memories and I decided to try out listening to Ghibli Soundtracks whilst doing my study-sessions.

Especially one specific kind of villain.","Mendelsohn's played all sorts of roles, both hero and villain and also those inbetween and he can certainly play a frightening and intimidating villain (see ""Animal Kingdom"", where he's flat out terrifying). But his speciality for villains tends to be smug snake villains who think they are far more powerful then they really are and then get a rude awakening. Often multiple rude awakening. Three examples come to mind in particular:

""Dark Knight Rises"" - Ostensibly the guy behind Bane's plans, but only so far as to take over Wayne Enterprises. Tries to throw his weight around to show Bane he's in charge, only for Bane to fatally show he's definitely NOT. (""And this gives you power over me?"")

""Ready Player One"" - Introduced as the Big Bad threatening a hostile takeover of the OASIS, but actually a wimpy, out of touch dorky corporate tool dumb enough to leave his password out where someone could snatch it, who constantly underestimates the heroes and whose own far more competent henchwoman punches him in the face at the end once they're both arrested. Even his backstory shows him as a lowly intern largely ignored and only kept around because he was prompt with getting lattes.

""Rogue One"" - Probably the best and most entertaining example as a running theme of the film is Orson Krennic getting humiliated and belittled and shown he means basically nothing to the Empire despite being the guy behind the freaking Death Star. At times it seems like Vader and Tarkin have a contest going to see who can essentially kick him in the balls the worst. And then he meets his end knowing the Ersos screwed him most of all.

There's more examples, but those are the best known. And Mendelsohn excels in all of them. I hope he keeps it up, because his humiliated villains are always fun to watch as it blows up in their faces...literally for Krennic.",119,355

I was watching ""High Frequency"" the other week, an 80s direct-to-TV movie, in which a technician, working at a satellite telecommunication station high up in the Swiss alps, manages to pick up signals from a boy, living on an island near the USA and operating a CB radio, and later an unknown video signal apparently showing a real life murder - and both of them try to uncover this mystery then.

For the most part of the movie, the technician is stuck in the alps, and the boy is stuck on the island, so their ways to interact with the world are very limited, and the main part is about long distance communication.

The movie takes liberty with technical details and realism, but I enjoyed it, there is a sense of suspense, and it was much less cheesy than I expected.

&amp;#x200B;

It made me realize there are quite some movies with a theme of ""action at a distance"".

A more well-known example is Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"", where the means of interaction for the main protagonist are more or less limited to his binoculars, telephone, and talking with his friends and his love interest, while he is trying to resolve a murder mystery.

""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" is an 80s spy movie where a stranger slides into Whoopie Goldberg's pre-internet DMs while she is operating a computer at her office job; it turns out he is actually a US spy, trapped behind the ""Iron Curtain"" in Eastern Europe, and Whoopie is his only means of communication and help. In this movie, she is of course not stuck in a remote place; but the spy protagonist is, and he gives her commands and information from thousand of kilometers away.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what are some other movies where a protagonist only interacts remotely with the environment, for most part of the film?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not so much interested in movies where someone gets kidnapped, locked up, but still manages to phone a stranger;

While they more or less fit this definition, they are vastly different from the ones I mentioned; the plot is then purely driven by despair, it lacks strategic planning, careful investigation, the cat-and-mouse chase; the antagonist is already aware of the protagonist (for a large part of the first two movies, the antagonists are not aware they are 'being watched'), and the agency of the protagonists is severely diminished.

&amp;#x200B;

I would also exclude movies with a situation in which it is normal to have a 'remote operator' on the team.

Like a Mission Impossible or Charlie's Angels type of movie, or those about armed forces / ""commando"" operations in general.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, I would say there should be an ""unusual"" (but not unrealistic) situation that leads to this setting.",14,0

the first noteworthy example was 2013's mama. the original mama short film is often considered to be one of the best youtube short films due to it's mysteriousness, good effects, and genuine fear factor. the short managed to get the attention of guillermo del toro, who offered the short's writer and director andy muschietti the chance to expand on his idea. andy's answer was an enthusiastic yes and the end result was mama. andy would return as writer and director with del toro serving as the film's executive producer. the film would also star jessica chastain in the lead role and would be released the same week as her film zero dark thirty. the film opened to an impressive 28,402,310 dollars on it's opening weekend and would end it's theatrical run having made 148.1 million dollars worldwide. the film would recieve mixed reviews with many critics praising the technical aspects as well as the performances while criticizing...pretty much everything else. nevertheless, andy muschietti's filmmaking career continued to grow, directing both parts of the it duology and 2023's the flash. later that year, it was announced that andy would be directing batman the brave and the bold, a film in the upcoming DCU.

up next is 2016's lights out. it's impossible to make a list of the scariest youtube videos without mentioning lights out. the video has been praised for it's atmosphere and very good payoff. it was only a matter of time before hollywood began to take notice and allowed david F sanberg to make a feature film based on his short. the film would serve as sanberg's feature film directorial debut and would also have james waan as producer. the film would open in july of 2016 and, despite coming out the same week as star trek beyond, actually managed to make quite a bit of cash at the box office. the film itself would recieve largely positive reviews with many feeling that sanberg took full advantage of the feature film format and the increased budget. sanberg took what started as a creepy video with a jumpscare ending and turned it into a character study on mental illness. the ending did spark some controversy over it's apparent endorsement of suicide as a method to solve one's problems. a week after the film's release, a sequel would be announced. however, as of 2024, no updates have been given. as for sanberg, he would go onto director annabelle creation, a film in the conjuring film series. he would also join the ranks of horror filmmakers who have directed superhero movies when he directed 2019's shazam and 2023's shazam fury of the gods. 

finally, there's 2024's night swim. night swim was a lesser known short film directed by bryce mcguire. however, obviously someone noticed it because, ten years after the original short was uploaded to youtube, james waan offered mcguire the chance to expand on his original concept. 2024's night swim was mcguire's feature film debut and would have waan and jason blum serving as producers. the film starred wyatt russell (who was still riding on the success of having just joined the MCU) and kerry condon(who was enjoying the perks of the career boost that banshees of inishirin gave her) as the two leads. the film would open on january 5th of 2024 and it would sadly join the lists of awful movies that have released during that month. night swim recieved overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics, many of whom felt that the film's concept did not lend itself to a feature film and they can see why the original was a SHORT film. the film did make 32.5 million dollars at the box office was briefly held the record for the highest grossing movie of 2024. only time will tell if bryce mcguire is given another chance to show off the talent that he obviously has.",1,0

Well, I understand that this film has its fans, but I am definitely not one of them. I did find things to admire in it: the cinematography is solid, it has some really impressive effects shots in it, and as always, Joaquin Phoenix gives a very committed and convincing performance. But those things on their own are not enough to make this bloated and agonizing movie worth watching. It is a downright punishing 3-hour experience, and it offers essentially zero catharsis during its entire run. 

While there are a sparse handful of amusing moments spread out over the movie, it's nowhere near enough to justify watching the film for its comedy, which leaves its miserable narrative as the sole reason I can see to engage with it, and that ultimately ends up feeling pointless and frustrating.

All that being said, I've no desire to argue if you liked it; everyone has different tastes, and I can see why some people would like certain things about it that I hated. If nothing else, I absolutely can't deny its uniqueness.. I've never seen anything else quite like it.

Almost all of one of my daughters favorite parts were missing (Schmendrick being immortal, dumping water on the mayor's head, Hagsgate, Prince Lir sticking out his tongue at the charging red bull, Princess Alison Jocelyn and more).

It was hard to appreciate the story being told without comparing it to the absolutely amazing, beautiful book. It was one of my daughters favorite books we've read, and the movie came across as so bitterly disappointing in comparison. Amalthea sings for some reason? None of the great songs in the book came over, they just wrote sappy, bad new ones.

&amp;#x200B;

The movie gets such praise and I can't tell if we just missed what made it good, or the people who loved it enjoyed it because of what it came close to. I have loved adaptations in the past but this movie just seemed so... jilted and quick. Like speedrunning through events of the story without hitting on almost any of the beauty or poetry. For every ounce of melancholy and heart the movie has, it came from cutting 10 pounds of it from the book. And again, some of the songs are so *weird* and out of place.... Like, they just wanted to be Disney so bad...

It hits a lot of good spots but the sum of the parts only add upto an okay film.

That said, let me say more.

The Good: 

Colin Farell. He was awesome. He had a small but fun role and I loved pretty much every bit of it. Hugh Grant was pretty interesting. It was strange to see him in the scumbag role, but he did it pretty well.

The plot. Its interesting. Plausible for the most part. It keeps ticking, much like the other Guy Ritchie movies. Dialog is mostly good. 

And other smaller characters: Dry Eye, Big Dave, The Toddlers, Jeremy Strong. Guy Ritchie writes good characters, like always.

The Bad:

I dont think Charlie Hunman was the right cast. He is pretty one note and is probably the most woody actor in the whole lot. He is both too young and too old for the role. He does the cool demeanor + short fuse decently, but I think the role required either a more mature actor who could feel more appropriate for this *Consigliere* position or a younger actor who would embody the rudeness required for the rule. Since he makes up such a large part of the film, he is the weakest link here.

Mathew McConnaguey's Micheal was pretty one note too. His role was short but it did lack variety.

The plot was a little over complicated. There's a girl involved? And Russian Mafia too? I honestly cant remember too much about that. Maybe it wasnt even needed. Just the politics of the power struggle was probably enough of plot line.

A note on Tom Wu's George. Everything was upside down there. A person of asian origin is selling heroin and a white dude is selling weed - because it isnt as harmful and he feels morally superior for this. Given the historical context, its just tone deaf and kinda gross. It makes no sense why Micheal was able to walk in - armed - and threaten him to no consequence. A drug baron with no security? What even. idk just everything was wrong.

Obviously, a lot of movies set in the future or past are part of this category, so stuff like Idiocracy, Back to the Future, Brazil, and Sleeper is permissible. Sci-fi stories like Total Recall, Looper, Dark City and Mad Max also count, but I'd like to keep it reigned in closer to the movies set in slightly alternate universes, like the ones mentioned above.

Yes, the segment of Curly messing up the oath with his hands, hat, and cane is a self-plagiarized from a 1931 Buster Keaton film co-directed by Stooges producer Jules White.

Why were film makers so much more adventurous with guns back in the day? They weren't afraid to mix a SPAS-12 with a Thompson and cover it in plastic, or add bits and pieces to a Beretta 93R.

For people who don't want to read an essay, my short answer is I would really like to see Tarantino take on a retelling of a specific era of the Mafia.

I'm personally very disappointed to hear about The Movie Critic being sacked. I was really looking forward to seeing tarantino's last film being an homage, analysis, but mostly appreciation of new Hollywood.

Going forward with what we have however, my potential hot take is that i think his most brilliant movies are his historical rewritings.

They serve as some of the best genre pieces. Despite being an old-school man with many old-school philosophies, Tarantino's writing style feels very hyper modern with so many obvious well known classical influences. One obvious avenue he has yet to explore is the nostalgic mob movie. If there's one director I would love to see tackle it's him with his iconic dialogue.

That is to say I believe this could be an amazing opportunity to bring back John Travolta, Steve Buscemi, maybe even Sam Jackson and cast them as well-known/niche/fictional gangsters from the 20th century history. I think the casting possibilities could be wild, not to mention, Tarantino is an absolute master at this kind of stuff. It also gives him an opportunity to complete his ""historical canon"" in a sort of way and pay all the homages to new Hollywood that he wanted to with The Film Critic.

Maybe you won't agree but this is honestly a movie I would love to see from him that goes beyond simple fan service.",19,0

I both remember it vividly and vaguely at the same time. The book was also turned into a black &amp; white film.

After reading the book we then watched the movie for it and in it there's this man living in a room or pod underground with a giant screen in front of him, which is how everyone gets in contact with each other. He's all alone,  everyone lives alone. Well one day he decides he wants to visit his mother (idk why but I think she was bald, probably wasn't) who lives on the other side of the country/world and the only way there is via train. 

The train goes above ground, it's the only thing that ever goes above ground. As far as everyone in their world knows and is told, life on the surface is inhospitable. The train doesn't have windows or anything since there's no life on the surface. Some how he manages to get a peek outside of the train before it goes back underground. He ends up seeing movement on an (implied) green surface.

When he gets to his mother's place. He tells her about it. She tells him to forget it, there's nothing on the surface. He returns home later on. When home he starts to call people up on the giant screen and ask them about it. Everyone tells him to forget it. The council in charge contacts him to tell him to forget it cuz it's impossible to have seen anything moving on the surface since life isn't possible on the surface. They even show him a live feed of the surface and in it, it's lifeless, dry, and barren. Purely devoid of any possible life. But he knows what he saw.

He ends up getting in contact with somebody who has a group of people who want to leave their society and go to the surface because they all believe they've heard things moving above their homes, felt vibrations through the walls, but we're told that either they imagined these things or it could have been the trains moving above.

Anyways these people meet, they find a way out of the underground homes. Get to the surface and see fields and fields of grass (sucks it was in black and white, was probably really pretty). There's big metal circles gathered in clusters in some areas, presumably the tops to people's homes. Well anyways they decide they should go back and let people know the surface is hospitable and they can live up there just to be eaten alive by giant worms, about the size of a large dogs. 

The story/film-adaptation was meant to be some kinda piece about how we should trust the governing bodies when they tell us things because they're trying to protect us. But also how they should provide us with information on why we shouldn't do something. So we understand the risks, instead of getting hurt when we defy them because we feel like we're being lied to.

The story for me was basically a dumb/funny read about a horny teenager chainsaw dude until like 50 chapters in when I got hit by a ton of bricks, and re-read the story up til that point because I realized it was a not-so-subtle exploration of basic human needs and I ended up reading up on [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs) as a means of ""structuring"" the concepts being explored in the series.

A lot of people gave this movie shit when it came out and now i understand.  This movie is just so chaotic it’s impossible to really say, “oh man i love this movie 10/10!” Because it isn’t really.  It was nice seeing the predator dogs (forgot to mention I didn’t see the 2010 film either lmao but still remember them from that trailer) and the battle between fugitive and ultimate was lame and pretty unfair since fugitive is small and ultimate is much bigger/stronger so the battle was pretty quick.  Anyway yeah pretty crappy predator adaptation.  At least it was redeemed with prey a few years after.

I highly doubt it will just be a ""stunts"" oscar, but something like ""stunts and choreography"" to include the Tom Cruise type of big spectacle stunts, vehicle stunts, to dance  and fight choreography. 

Some arguments for it I have and have heard from others are that

- It would spark at least a little bit more action movies with more emphasis on practical effects and fight choreography, especially with the disdain for the overusage of CGI effects in recent action movies. Of course there are definitely great uses of CGI from Dune to even Top Gun, but I think more and more people are getting a bit tired of seeing movies completely washed with computer effects that do not blend in well with the movie (may be a product of pandemic filmed projects). It won't spark a revolution in all action movies being john wick, but it may be a start to more practicality. 

- It would give the stuntmen and choreographers the recognition they never had, if there is one team of a movie project that gets even less recognition than the VFX team, it is the stunt team. There is already SAG stunt award but SAG is still fairly small in its audience compared to the Oscars. Talk smack about the oscars all you want with whether you dislike the ceremony or its winners, getting a nomination or a win will definitely spark some level of interest for any movie. 

The most common argument AGAINST it -

- That it would promote dangerous work from stuntmen who just want to try for an oscar. I personally believe this is a bit of a bogus argument. These guys are professionals, and aren't going to be endangering themselves just to get an award. If you have this as an argument against having this category, then can't you say the same for the main actor awards? With a majority of the winners of the actor award being transformative and method acting, won't it promote more people to completely starve themselves like jared leto? To completely lose themselves in method acting and commit to super unhealthy lifestyles during filming? Or gain preposterous weight like Christian Bale? And the ""death defying"" stunts are already so few and far between, top of my head I guess you can include Tom cruise's mission impossible stunts, but other then that there's still going to be car chases, falling off buildings and making jumps. I just don't think there will be ""oscar baits"" for the stunt category just to get a stunt nomination. Unless the movie is completely banking on the stuntwork, the stuntmen aren't going to be doing anything unnecessarily dangerous work. 

- How will you judge the quality of stunts? Well like all these awards, are completely subjective. Don't see how this is a huge problem but have seen it as an argument against it. Could be amount of practical stunts or the quality and pure enjoyment of what we see. ",9,0

I thought he handed it over to Diane in the diner, and that she had it in her apartment the whole time. When she looks at the blue key, I thought, she agonizing over whether to go and use it to see the body, and know for sure the murder had happened.

But now I know better. (He keeps the key in the diner, and supposedly delivers it to her apartment later as a calling card, or something like that.)

BTW I am aware that the hitman says ""When it's finished you'll find THIS where I told you"", indicating the key. But I assumed this was his low-key way of referring to the proof (i.e. the victims head, hands, whole body, whichever) and the locker / trunk / mineshaft / old factory where it would be locked away. I'm also aware it was on a ring, but we never see him put it away.

(1) Did anyone else misunderstand the diner scene this way?

(2) Did Lynch intend for some of us to be misdirected in this way?

(3) If so, what value is there in that, when it's easily avoided with a dialog tweak?",3,6

I've read through quite a few old posts discussing the ending (some of which are valid, other than people expecting Sean to immediately arrest Jimmy with no evidence - even if that's what you emotionally want to happen) so don't need to go into that too much again, but there were a few things I was left wondering:

1. Why did Dave not just come clean about what happened that night to his wife? Surely killing a paedophile sexually assaulting a child is better than or at least equal to killing someone mugging him? But also why did he continue to make up new lies about what happened to his hand? Surely at least for continuity of his story's sake it would be better to stick to one lie? I get he's damaged by his abuse and clearly mentally unstable but he was able to act logically when being questioned by the police and outsmart them etc..
2. In one of the first scenes where Brendan surprises Katie in her car, he seems almost obsessive of her which led me to think maybe he killed her in a crime of passion when she rejected him/didn't reciprocate quite as much later on or something.. I know this doesn't fit with some other parts of the plot but seemed an interesting possibility. Rather, the real murder was the result of an unfortunate accident without real motivation - which is inherently less satisfying for the viewer when the case gets solved.. what are people's thoughts on this?
3. Does anyone have any good explanations of theories about the weird plotline with Sean's wife? What was the point of that like was there a reason she'd call him and not say anything? Maybe it's explored more in the book?",1,5

My guess is the sequel will reveal the second killer from the first film. And my guess is that it has to be Bobby or Ryan. I lean more towards Bobby. 

Bobby certainly has motive. Suffers a career ending injury due to a freak accident caused by all his friends. Him being gone for so long between the initial incident and the start up of the murders is very suspect. Not to mention, he seems to pop up everywhere it's convenient, and at a convenient moment. I also think we're supposed to like him more than we are Ryan, which would make the twist of him being a killer even more shocking. Not to mention, he follows Jess in her investigation, so he would have the closest inside information. And when examining the death scenes, I feel like height proportion changes between killers. And Bobby is shorter than the sheriff. 


I feel like we're getting a sequel where the likable ex boyfriend turns out to be the psycho, and the somewhat smug, unlikable current boyfriend ends up being the hero.

It's a film about an elderly man spurred to visit his brother because of said brother's. In essence, it's about taking advantage of the time you still have even when you're very old and frail and have some kind of physical impairment (with him breaking his hip at the start). Hell, Richard was also cancer ridden at the time too, but he still took the role anyway. He had an impairment but he was willing to still take the journey to make the film itself.

Plus through the film there's the notion of making up for the past despite the bad things that have happened with whilst you still have the time to do it and with the elderly, near at the end of his life Richard Farnsworth, there's something extra touching about this. It's obviously not his actual life story, but this was his last film and one of the last major things he did in his life. Alvin Straight himself also receives a dedication at the end, which kinda links up also.

Obviously death doesn't always have to change how a film is perceived, but I do think it's interesting to see how they are and how it can unintentionally up the themes or the emotional weight. And when there's dedications or it's their last film, or when it happened during the making of the film, it's hard for it not to be noted.

I still enjoyed it but I did notice that Patrick Swayze (Sam) did quite a few things that probably wouldn’t have gotten him into heaven. This movie has a lot of elements but one big one is morality. If you are a good person you go to heaven, if you are bad you go to hell. It really shouldn’t matter if the bad things you do are in life or in death especially if they effect other living people. With that said Sam basically plans his ex-friends (Carl) murder. He knows if there money from the Rita Miller account is gone the drug dealers will kill Carl.

After Sam talks Oda Mae into stealing the 4 million dollars in drug money and commit identity theft , Sam watched with joy as Carl fails to transfer the money. Then Sam jokes and laughs when he says the drug dealers are going to kill Carl, turn him into fertilizer and bury him next to Jimmy Hoffa.  Later Carl is freaking out with Molly and sam jokes that Carl needs some cyanide. It’s obvious that Sam has a plan to get Carl killed and he was so happy when it was coming together. 

Sam selfishly  also put Oda Mae and Mollys life in jeopardy all to get revenge and to kill Carl. Sam basically lied to Whoopi’s character Oda Mae when he told her that if she pretends to be Rita miller and steal the money then Carl and the drug dealers won’t ever mess with her again. Sam had to know this was a huge lie and would guarantee the exact opposite. They would never stop looking for her since she did steal 4 million dollars of laundered drug money. Sam had to know drug dealers would torture and then kill her especially if she didn’t have the money anymore. Sam even said “scouts honor” to Rita about Carl and Willie never bothering her again if she went to the bank and did what he said. He knew that was a lie. 

Sam gets Oda Mae to commit grand larcency, identity theft, fraud, and steal millions from a drug dealer without telling her any of these life threatening risks all so he can get his revenge. Later sam lies to Oda Mae again and says the only way she’ll be safe is if she donates the money when he knows that won’t do a thing to protect her, in fact it almost got her killed. If she kept the money she could have at least used it to save her life in case she was caught by the drug dealers. Without the money the drug dealers have no reason to keep her alive. 

Sam’s plan from the start was to have the drug dealers kill Carl. That was Sam’s only motivation and even though Carl was killed by a window lol, Sam  knew the drug dealers would kill Carl if his plan worked. Sam should have known that Oda Mae and Molly would be safe from Carl once the drug money was transferred so selfishly he almost got them killed all for his own revenge.  That basically makes Sam a premeditated murderer, identity and grand theft.  Seems to me Sam should have had those shadow demons take him away instead of going to heaven. At the very least Sam should have stayed on earth instead of going to heaven the moment he killed his murderers. Even though Carl never really wanted Sam dead, he just wanted his wallet. Willie killed Sam and that didn’t seem on purpose. The only person in this movie that premeditated crimes like murder was Sam.

As you would expect from the typical eighties blockbuster, its ending credits are quite long, and involve an army of actors, technicians and production staff. We’re talking hundreds of names rolling for almost ten minutes, mostly laid out on a single column - sometimes two - and in a reasonably large font. These days, though, such a list is probably what you’d find at the end of some independent movie; a similar production - think Marvel, for instance - usually has a credits roll with **thousands** of names, sometimes on four or five columns, almost unreadable, who goes on for 15+ minutes. 

Why is that? Have movie productions really become that much larger? Are really so many more people involved? Or are just more people **credited** than in the past? Or is there some other reason?",9,0

(SPOILERS),"I was writing a post about how I thought it would be a better movie overall and have a better ending if it had ended on the night shot of the truck on the road, riding away, and that following it with the subsequent daytime scene in the desert weakens it overall for two main reasons. But then, something suddenly clicked.

First, my reasons supporting the removal of the very last scene:

1. It deprives us of the ambiguity of the next-to-last scene, in which we are never sure how much is drug-fueled hallucination and how much is really happening. Are Lou and Jackie getting away or are they dying? The following scene, when the drug's effects had to have worn off, confirms they did get away. Less interesting as an ending IMO.

And 2. The last remaining sympathy I had for Lou is gone by her choking Daisy to death. I mean, Daisy is treated as the butt-monkey of the story all through, but she didn't really deserve to die. She was clingy but at the point she was shot she was in a position in which she wouldn't be ratting out Lou or Jackie, so I think both Lou and the movie are being too nasty by having her survive just to be unceremoniously choked to death by our main character. It's like we were intended to cheer at that or someting...

AND here, it clicked. I was also about to argue that the scene did not contribute much plot-wise or character-wise, until I thought... Maybe we're not really supposed to cheer at the choking. Maybe what we're being shown is Lou becoming very much as ruthless and cold as her dad, which not only shows her dehumanization but paints a bleak future for her relationship with Jackie as well, given how Lou Sr.'s marriage failed miserably. So, I guess it may be a matter of how one approaches it.

It is an effective modernisation of many folkloric tales from the region, and (personally) is shot and acted beautifully, and leaves a distinct mournful emptiness once you finish it.

It follows a family who is trapped in their house by a mysterious stranger who is able to control their daughter. It is visceral, heartfelt and deeply meaningful in all the best ways, and has quickly become one of my favourite horror films of all time. One of the film's greatest assets is its wonderful acting - the leads put everything they can into their performances, and it shows, lending to the unsettling atmosphere. The colours, choice of location and way the camera is used are not only very effective, but also show off one of the first times Guajarati cinema has tried using these techniques in a horror film (most modern Gujarati films being Romcoms). The film looks stunning, even though it was made on a budget of only $400,000.

There has also been a Big-Budget Hindi Remake for Bollywood, called 'shaitan'. Having seen both, I believe that Vash is just a superior film in every way. Though the Hindi film has some of my favourite actors in it (even the lead actress from Vash reprising her role) it is worse in a few ways:

* Worse cinematography:
   * With a budget eleven times the size of the original, I do not know how they managed to make it look like a soap opera.
* Worse acting:
   * Other than Janki Bodiwala, the rest of the cast give overacted, bland performances. Toned down and largely heartless.
   * The characters in the original were nuanced, and the antagonist and his intentions was kept mysterious and subtly sinister, with hints of his true motives being slowly revealed as the plot progressed. In the remake, he is never actually scary, just melodramatic, coming off largely as some sort of Bargain bin evil sorcerer where we know what he is doing and why he is doing it.
   * The father served as a symbol for parental control and power, the daughter for the long-lasting traumatic effects it can have. In shaitaan... Nothing.
   * The symbols which appear through the film (tea leaves, fish, phone, scissors) are absent from this one, meaning the plot is largely thin and the atmosphere suffers greatly.
   * The violence in the remake is largely mindless and toned-down. In the original, it is visceral and everything has a meaning or emotion associated with it.
   * There is a random chase/action sequence in the remake which only adds to the lack of verisimilitude already present in the film, swapping a motorbike chase for a slow, painfully slow sequence of the father limping towards his where his daughter has been taken in the original
   * Everything has been toned down to make it less disturbing. The slow and creeping horror is replaced with strangely comedic 'scary' sequences and jump scares.
   * There is a GENERIC BOLLYWOOD SONG in the middle of it. The tonal whiplash is **so** bad.
   * The setting where the film takes place. The original uses the bright and airy, modern, opulent house to help convey the fact that this is a normal family, and help convey just how wrong and out of place what is happening is. It is also expertly and systematically destroyed as the story progresses, always by the family itself, serving to represent their failing family dynamic.
      * For reference, this would be like taking Parasite, and setting it in a dark haunted house, then also adding random jump scares and a bad song in the middle of it, and bad acting and none of the symbols that make the movie meaningful, and also it looks like Seinfeld.
* And worse of all...
   * Likely to please mass audiences, the ending was changed from a melancholic, thoughtful and ambiguous one to a (frankly rushed) happy ending where the father (now clearly the main character, compared to Vash's emphasis on the daughter, and the family as a unit being slowly degraded) heroically saves the day through a poorly thought out narrative loophole.
   * There are no links to the original's key themes of the lasting effects that violence and the resulting trauma can have on a person, the thought-provoking message being traded for feel-good music and a last scene which is devoid of any of the the context it had in the original which made it powerful in the first place.

In conclusion, Shaitan is a heartless, boring, pandering cash-grab with literally nothing for it.

Just go watch Vash Instead.

(p.s. the director of Shaitan has had Vash removed from every major streaming platform so people are forced to watch his terrible remake, so it may be hard to find, but should be back to being available in a bit.)

TL,DR: Vash is good. Shaitaan is a boring cash grab in every way imaginable.",2,1

They described it as a character who is built up as some kind of ultimate badass, then get easily or unceremoniously killed off. They used Robert Muldoon from Jurassic Park as their example, and I'm going to explain why that's a terrible example. 

Muldoon is never built up as some kind of ultimate badass. He's a short pants wearing game warden, and the only Ingen employee who has any respect for the danger the dinosaurs pose. The opening scene where the worker is killed shows he's as unequipped as anyone to control the situation, but that's the whole point of the story, and I think he understood that.

Faults aside, he is kind of a badass though. He puts himself in danger while trying to save the worker during the opening scene. After the T-Rex attack, he and Sattler, with the T-Rex still on the loose, race to the scene of the attack to try to save any survivors. They rescue and perform first aid on Malcolm. Remember ""must go faster, must go faster?"" Remember who was driving the Jeep? When they're trying to restore the power, Muldoon, fully aware that the raptors are free, goes with Sattler and when he realizes they're being stalked, basically uses himself as bait so she can get to the shed.

He played alongside Paul Dano and Emile Hirsch in a high school comedy called ”The Girl Next Door” (2004). Had a few more smaller roles during the 00’s. Since then, his career seems to have stalled and he’s not too happy about it.

He’s written his bio himself, which is probably not that uncommon, except it’s not written in 3rd person but in 1st. He writes:

*My 35 year professional acting career can be defined as follows:*

*Being recognized in an Uber.. While driving someone to the airport.*

He goes on about all the missed opportunities he’s had, or, as he calls it, a ”Groundhog Day event of nearly being cast in life changing roles and somehow never crossing that threshold”

It’s a hilarious read and definitely a fun break from the usual, self-glorifying profiles!

Adam Driver plays Caesar Catilina (Originally Serge Catiline)

Giancarlo Esposito plays Franklyn Cicero (Just a Modified Name, probably still called Frank)

Nathalie Emmanuel plays Julia Cicero (Name stayed the same)

Aubrey Plaza plays Wow Platinum (Originally Wow Baltimore)

Shia LaBeouf plays Clodio Pulcher (Originally Claude Hamilton)

Jon Voight plays Hamilton Crassus III (Originally Gene Hamilton)

Jason Schwartzman plays Jason Zanderz (Originally Davy Cato)

Grace Vanderwaal plays Vesta Sweetwater (Name stayed the Same)

Laurence Fishburne plays Fundi Romaine (Name stayed the same)

Kathryn Hunter plays Teresa Cicero (Name was just Terry Cicero)

Dustin Hoffman plays Nush Berman (Name stayed the same)

D.B Sweeney plays Commissioner Hart (Wasn't confirmed in the cannes page, but Sweeney confirmed it a year ago on his twitter page)

Now looking at the characters, it is clear that Coppola has decided to really go back to Rome's roots. I will say that I liked some of the original names, like Claude Hamilton and Davy Cato, but I hope Coppola can pull this through.

First we got Carrie (1976), which got the first remake in 2002 and then another one in 2013; in this case they all tell the same exact story with only minor tweaks, with the TV one &gt;!having Carrie actually survive at end, as it was supposed to start a TV show, that was cancelled!&lt;.

Then there is The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974), a crime film about a group of criminals, referring to themselves with colors (later inspiring Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs), hijacking a metro car and holding it for ransom, with the leader, Mr Blue, only communicating with the subway dispatcher on the phone. It was remade in 1998, trying to stay more for faithful to the novel, but having little success, and then finally remade by Tony Scott in 2009, with his signature style.

Both these cases also changed the setting to the production years, having to update the use of tech in the stories: for communication and rail traffic management in Pelham, and in regard to bullying in Carrie.

movies,t3_1ckpntp,1714910419.0,/r/movies/comments/1ckpntp/whats_your_favorite_secret_garden/,t2_soww99oz,Discussion,What's your favorite Secret Garden?,"Francés Hudgson Burnett's childrens classic has been retold numerous times through books and movies. As someone who grew up with the 1993 version starring Kate Maberly as Mary Lennox, that version is near and dear to me, but after listening to the audiobook (read by Karen Savage) I decided to go back and watch every single version of the story I could find.

The 1975 BBC version starring Sarah Hollis Andrews is by far my favorite (second after the 93 one), as it sticks closer to the book and has a great cast. I was initially not a fan of it, as the repeated lines from the book made it feel like they were just soullessly reading from the script, but upon rewatches (it was initially made as a 7 episodes series and then cut down to a 1½ hour movie), it slowly grew on me, like the garden its story centers on. This is the third series BBC produced though, as there is also one from 1952 allegedly missing all 8 episodes, and a 1960 version missing 3 out of 8.

Then there is the 1987 version starring Gennie James which would be my least favorite because of its more cynical depiction of Mary, were it not for the 1949 version which changes several things and tells other things completely out of order, though it does introduce some interesting new story elements. There is also the 1994 animated version, which makes house mistress Mrs Medlock a straight up villain who seeks to poison Colin so she can inherit the mansion.

There is the very creatively different steampunk version from 2017, seeing Glennellen Anderson in the role of a slightly older Mary Lennox, that has a lot of cool ideas and love put into it, but in my opinion unfortunately moves too fast and falls flat on some aspects. Then there is the most recent remake from 2020 with Dixie Egerrickx as Mary which I found interesting because it had one of the Harry Potter directors behind its production which of course meant a heap of special effects. Unfortunately, again, I was not a fan of several aspects of this interpretation, mainly how some things feel out of order. Like how Mary doesn't even need the key to get inside the garden but instead just scales the wall, and then later uses the key which is then played up as a ""big moment"" long after the magic has vanished.

Strangely, I enjoy the older versions more for their lack of computer effects, as I feel they tell a more genuine story and sell mother nature as an element of beauty that don't need no fancy graphics.

Lastly, the only version I couldn't get my hands on, aside from the missing episodes of the previously mentioned BBC shows, was the very first movie from 1919 which was a b/w silent film as it is allegedly classified as lost media.

Yes, the rabbithole of interpretations of this book runs rather deep, but considering it is over 100 years old now that is hardly a surprise, and I love digging into the sometimes convoluted history of something and catalogue how many different versions there are. I even managed to get ahold of Sarah herself some 50 years later (Mary from the 75 version) and have her send me an autograph, as well as get my hands on a super rare Danish translation of the book from 1985 published by Danish ""Gyldendal"".

All this, because it is a magical tale that touched and resonated with me as a kid, and one I feel every kid should watch or read at least once. I was always a very patient kid, so it didn't bother me that the 93 movie had very slow scenes. Kids of today may find it boring because of that, but then maybe the 2020 version, despite my own gripes with it, is more up their alley.

It's strange, because I myself didn't grow up to be a nature lover in any way. I'm a gamer, otaku, and couch potato who only goes outside on errands... yet the story itself is one of my favorites because of its serenity and themes of friendship.

I did not see any previews and was begrudgingly forced to watch this with my girlfriend at the time. I thought that with Robert Pattinson's Twilight success, this would be a predictable quick buck romance movie that the studios could slap together. I was wrong.

Robert nailed his character! Tyler was dark, lovable, and a shell of a human being - Something I believe a lot of us can relate to. His love for his sister was infinite and other than Alley, it was the only light in life. His performance turned me into a fan.

Another actor who blew me away because I believe he has under achieved is Pierce Brosnan. I'm going to catch a lot of heat for this, but I believe this was his best performance. His character was charming, selfish, and caring all at the same time. He was so charming, that the dinner scene with Tyler and Alley had me believing Tyler was entitled by how he treated his father.

The boardroom fight between Tyler and Charles is probably one of the most powerful scene from a movie that I have seen in a long time.

I wont ruin the ending for those of you that haven't seen it, but it was magnificent. To deal with all the drama and pain throughout the movie, especially between Robert and Pierce and then for it to end the way it did hurt so fucking much. It was an unexpected twist for someone who went in blind and I am so happy I saw it that way.

Anyway, let me know what you think about this movie! Did you have the same reaction?

Your thoughts on the ending?,"If you're reading you've most likely watched the movie. But just in case here is the gist of it:

*Late Night TV host Jack Delroy (David Dastmalchian) hosts a Halloween special where they invite a handful of Medium (Psychic) to come on the show and demonstrate there supernatural talents. Some try to trick the shows audience while another claims their demonstrations are true. As the movie progresses it becomes disturbing, even grotesque.*

So recently I signed up for AMC+ mainly to binge watch the Walking Dead: the Ones Who Live and other Walking Dead spin off. After I was browsing through (a lot of good stuff looked surprisingly good) I ran into Late Night with the Devil. I was very pleased with David Dstmalchian acting. I recognized him from many movies. He seemed to have short parts, kind of like the random guy. One I remember he was it Batman. I digress. To be honest I was drawing while playing the movie infront of me and very quickly found myself mostly glued to the TV. By the time it finished I was left confused. I dunno, maybe drawing distracted me on some key points. That's why I was hoping you could give me your input and thoughts on it. My theory (and I'm probably completely wrong) is the movie basically saying Jack sold his soul to the Devil for his fame. What that has to do with his deceased wife and his obvious love connection with Laura (June Ross Mitchell) I have no idea. 

In a weird way the movie kind of reminded me of the very first 2004 movie Saw. The entire movie taken place in one room (maybe two if you include backstage).

The main man is so horrible and even the man he’s telling his tale is horrified and he seen a lot. 
This would be a one time watch for me. That been said, it has some shots that are very beautiful. Some things in this movie is very very disturbing. 
The art in the movie is his explanations and deviations from being a normal human being. It could be said to be the closest thing I can imagine real killers to be thinking aside from Netflix’s Mindhunter. I say art because that’s how he describes it. 
He doesn’t know how to talk to people and how different he is shows. That being said, how anything happens in here is incredulous.

What's a whodunit film that you know how it ends and still enjoy watching?,"The Fugitive (1993) is a thriller that in my opinion is one of the best movies Harrison Ford has ever been in. It's up there with Witness and his most memorable roles. The writing is sharp, the characters relatable, and the story is believable. The performances  are topnotch, especially that of Tommy Lee Jones. The villain is not your typical villain, nor is the hero your typical hero, yet I was glued to the screen from the beginning to the end. No scene is wasted, it seems to me, and everything contributes to making this great film. A friend of mine studying film says they use The Fugitive's screenplay for her screenwriting class. I'm not surprised.

Often knowing who done it is reason to no longer enjoy a movie but this is not the case here, as I still enjoy watching it very much.

I’d argue that the ‘The Air Up There” (1994) can go punch for punch with almost any other movie about team sports. ,"
*The Air Up There (1994)* is unique in how it intertwines the worlds of basketball and African tribal culture while always keeping it fun.

After watching it, I became obsessed with following traveling professional scouts of all major sports. I know it’s just a movie, but the truth of the matter is that scouts are asked to go halfway across the globe to not only evaluate talent, but also to build a lasting relationship in order to learn as much as they can about the prospect. 

Kevin Bacon's portrayal of a brash basketball coach tasked with going to Africa to recruit a talented tribal player is IMO depicted perfectly. This is a nightmare scenario for any scout, and even though a lot of the specific plot points are exaggerated, Bacon flawlessly represents the archetype of the modern disgruntled scout. Bacon's character undergoes incredible personal growth, which eventually culminates in his discovery that the love of sports is a shared universal language. Personally, I think Bacon’s portrayal of Jimmy Dolan in *The Air Up There (1994)* is one of his best performances. With only his role as REN in *Footloose (1984)*, Val in *Tremors (1990)*, and Wade in *The River Wild (1994)* being objectively better performances. 

The movie takes a deep dive into the common trope of having to make the choice of either pursuing your dreams or doing what your family expects of you. You can’t help yourself from feeling something when watching this movie. The film is riddled with humor that doesn’t at all feel out of place and actually adds to the  heartwarming moments. Ultimately, the movie is just simply fun, and effortlessly entertaining. 

[*The Air Up There (1994)*](https://youtu.be/SrzzJrCbU_I?si=5BozniZAtl4JhdDG) is a standout film and IMO, a top tier sports film. ",13,10

Spoilers in this thread. 

This is a French animated film, but you get a lot of noir and cyberpunk influences—I can see Ghost in the Shell, The Matrix (and especially The Animatrix spin-off), Blade Runner, Robocop and The Terminator in the making of this world. I wouldn’t be surprised if this gets mistaken for a Japanese anime. 

I don’t know if this is only in the English dub, but there were some heavy exposition dumps. Much like The Creator last year, there is definitely a detailed world, with enough character asides to suggest and show how the world works, but it’s still only about an hour and a half, and you get a lot thrown at you. Also an interesting choose to sometimes have characters speaking over scenes and not make it immediately apparent who (or what) is speaking. 

In fact, even the main theme of robots and sentience and freedom isn’t entirely apparent until the end. We find out that Carlos, the main robot, is living his Robocop-like afterlife as a robot duplicate of a deceased cop. Robots in this universe are subject to human control—and those who chose to become duplicates (or are created as duplicates) seem to have full human memories and emotions but are also subject to bring controlled. That seems like it should be a bigger issue? We see robots get “jailbroken” and gain freedom, but even the semi-human duplicates are like, yup, those machines are going crazy. The existence of human duplicates versus traditional machines, and what freedoms means to each, feels like it could have been a full movie on its own. 

I’m sitting here, thinking, well, it was well-animated, the dub was good, the story made sense, and yet it feels like something is kidding. Something is just too big to fit in this movie’s run-time. ",10,8

I thought at the time that she was an electrifying new voice and she's followed up in spectacular fashion.

Kristian Stewart knocks this out of the park. I always forget what an extraordinary actor she is. I'll always be a fan of The Twilight movies because of her and I don't care who knows it.

Saint Maud was a slow burn portrait of loneliness and obsession with a killer sting in its tail but Love Lies Bleeding is a brilliantly visceral, sucker punch of a film. Tactile, physical - a Cronenbergian sensibility to it.

The politics are obvious and subtle at the same time. It's about womens power, about women being physically as well as emotionally strong yet you never get the sense that message is being directed at you. It's so much more than the trailer gives it credit for because of its artful politics as well as its sweaty, passionate, lustful, violent themes.

Cronenberg is a master at taking a characters internal rage and externalising it, turning it into something physical (see - The Brood) and there's a lot of that in this but it's balanced with a musical element, dancing really. The body building poses, the sweaty sex scenes. Mesmerising.

It's a really confident movie from both director and actors. You can't take your eyes off any of the characters. Stewart, O'Brian and Harris as well as literally every one of the supporting cast are extraordinary.

The sound design and camerawork really complimented the plot as well, particularly in the scenes around the basketball court/game and streets around the school where the camera glides low, almost crawling. 

Any suggestions for other indie thrillers? Hoping to find something great I haven’t seen yet to watch tonight. Thank you! ",75,157

There just are movies where, if you were to make them 100 times in alternate universes, they would fail 98 times. Here's why Twisters (2024), with a larger budget (adjusted), will fail to replicate that success:

1. Likeable main characters: There was almost no one more likeable than 1990s Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. As a movie producer, if you had that, it would feel like a free win. Almost no effort was needed to make those characters relatable or likeable. Twisters (2024) doesn't have this free pass. It's possible they do it, but unlikely.

2. Novel ideas: This was before the mainstream internet. Unless you were lucky enough to catch a news segment, or a Discovery channel special on storm chasers, you didn't know they existed. That added mystery and real adventure to the movie. Twisters (2024) doesn't have this.

3. Special effects: The 1990s were a dividing line in the history of movies. There have always been special effects, but the game was taken to a whole new level in the 90s with the availability of good computers and software. I remember watching Jurassic Park (1993) in the theater. It wasn't impressive from a special effects angle just because they were great, it was also impressive because the idea of effects that good was a novel idea to theater goers. Twisters (2024) will likely have better effects, but they won't be new. You've seen it before.

4. Quality acting: The level of talent on Twister (1996) was higher than you would expect. It wasn't just names you recognize, it was genuinely capable and experienced actors. Twisters (2024) may end up having good performances, but it just won't be comparable.",56,0

A little explanation:


-the woman/man (the one two other like) minds their own business and builds a spark with one of them.


-subtle interaction through body language and such, or insiders jokes/languages that only the two understand . Makes the third person does not realize it until late. (But not a backstabbing kind of thing, just missing the noment or not meant to be kind of thing).

I prefer something from pre 2010s (old movies from 50s onwards are okay too), or newer movie with older movie aesthetic. Does not need to be mixed culture, but if it is then good (increasing my reference to more cultures). Young or more adult couple are fine.

It is probably more common than I thought, but  i cant recall and i want to see some suggestions.

I think Beth's issue is her inability to show vulnerability, to show lack of control, because when you allow yourself to break, everything comes crumbling down, and in her mind, she probably resented Conrad because he couldn't keep it under control, he was stlll in mourning and in trauma and it was a constant reminder of what the family lost. 

As Mary Tyler Moore has often said, she never saw Beth as a monster but as a victim of her own upbringing. 

Look at the scene where she talks to her mother, just that moment shows how Beth was probably raised. And Beth does even try to get close to Conrad, they have a nice conversation in the garden but then Conrad starts acting ""weird"" and it makes her tense and uncomfortable.",18,31

It's like a haunted artifact that will doom any date night. And I love it.

I had often read the film was legendary for starting couple arguments. My way back ex and I knew about this long before watching it and (we of such hubris) said it couldn't possibly be that divisive, that we would remain objective and reasonable in our discussion after and yet STILL had a terrible argument. Today I am happily married and know I will never watch this film with my wife.

I think DeVito perfectly crafted a movie that plays on all the personal insecurities, needs, and pet peeves that men and women each have to make the two members of a hetero couple watching the film relate to either Douglas or Turner's point of view. Then the film makes the characters both so horrible that you cannot possibly understand why someone would think the other character (who you don't see any redeeming qualities in) is in the right. And so an argument starts with each taking a side and getting angrier at eachother as the film draws on a lot of very common underlying relationship issues. And the reality is, neither Douglas or Turner were in the right, they are both just awful people. It is a wonderful abomination of a film.

Spoiler Alert:

I really enjoyed ""American Sniper"".  Chris Kyle had his critics, but as a film, I thought it a great viewing experience (even with the fake baby).  But I was truly brought to tears in its final scene, where we experence our protagonist's funeral, which was made all the more poignant by the fact that director, Clint Eastwood used Ennio Morricone's ""The Funeral"".  That piece of music not only came from the soundtrack of a Spaghetti Western - a genre that made Eastwood a megastar, but was also composed by the same composer that composed the Spaghetti Westerns that Eastwood starred in. 

  
The other would be the finale of ""The Social Network"".  I'm a big Beatles fan, so I knew instantly what the song was, that was playing in the background, whilst Mark Zuckerberg successfully won his lawsuit.  ""Baby, You're a Rich Man"" not only alludes to our protagonist's financial windfall, it also alludes to how much money that director, David Fincher was willing to spend on this exact scene.  Everyone should know how expensive it is get copyright clearance from the Fab Four to use their song in your film.

The summary of the movie is that it's about a woman (Aoy) who works in a noodle shop in a destitute area of Thailand, she slaves away through sweat and routine until a strange, well kept man obfuscated by the poverty around him, takes a bite of her food only to immediately offer her an audition as a cook for one of Thailand's most prestigious chefs (Chef Paul). The chef in question is an enigmatic figure of authority with a hidden lust for power and perfection. The story walks us through her vertical progression from a poor cook to a renowned chef while emphasising that without love and familial support, she has actually made regression.

What appealed to me was just how brilliant the acting was, you could see Aoy as a wonderfully soft woman imprisoned by the hardened shell of her humble life, the actors eyes really show all of this  as you can see her eyes going from having a piercing glare to a gentle embrace as she moves away from her old life into more comfort. The switch of hardness to kindness is so telling of her abilities and I really think that her acting alone is a work of art.

Chef Paul's actor deserves an equal amount of praise, I swear the movie isn't meant to be a thriller but the shear psychopathy his walk exudes made me genuinely feel uneasy, he's so emotionless until he unleashes this tsunami of anger, it's honestly terrifying, I don't know how but he didn't just highlight him as a villain, he brought a cold chill with him... I swear if I ever see a picture of the actor smiling I'll have a brain bleed.

For Mafia 3

  
Lincoln Clay - John Boyega

John Donovan - Timothy Oliphant/Alden Ehrenreich

Vito Scaletta - Oscar Isaac (older Vito)

Father James - Idris Elba 

Sal Marcano - Michael Douglas

Thats about it up until now, who would you guys pick?

Jodie Foster as Katie, the lead's past love whom he finds out had committed suicide which leads him to remembering their past relationship has all the tropes you'd expect.

Just a sample, here's a listing of some of the well-known characters based on Eastwood's cool badass anti-hero.

Mad Max - Even referred to as ""The Man With No Name"" in ""Thunderdome"" and Bruce Spence plays different characters in different movies a la Lee Van Cleef.

Snake Plesskin - Right down to Carpenter bringing in Van Cleef himself to play off against Russell.

El Mariachi - His ""first name"" is literally ""The.""

Beatrix Kiddo - Only known as ""The Bride"" until more than halfway through ""Vol 2."" If you needed any further proof of the Leone influence, see how Tarantino swiped Angel Eyes' intro from ""Good, Bad &amp; Ugly"" for Bill's intro, including the music.

Boba Fett - Note how Boba's outfit matches Eastwood's color-wise, right down to having a poncho of sorts. And this even before the creation of the Angel Eyes-inspired Cad Bane.

And that's just a sampling of the famous ones. If you have any more examples, feel free to share them.",16,0

I just watched 12 Monkeys (1996) and I was honestly impressed by the complexity of the storyline. I loved how it kept me wondering whether Bruce Wills’ character was crazy. Brad Pitt was phenomenal. Even moreso, the culprit behind the virus came as a plot twist.

I love psychological thrillers and I especially love movies where the viewer is kept in the day. However, over the past 2 decades, I feel as though storylines have become overly simplistic despite getting longer? 

For example, a Netflix mini-series could total 7 hours but contain a storyline that could be told in a hour and a half. Comparatively movies from the 90s/00s even, tell complex story’s with intricate details in 2 hours. Has anyone else observed this? 

For context, I was born in 1997 and I’m finding that, if I want a good movie, I have to watch ones released when I was a child. ",18,0

Archie is a horrible friend. If you say you love your best friend and still mislead her the way he misled her. You’re not a good friend and he don’t truly love someone. love is something that’s supposed to be self sacrificial and he wasn’t even able to let go for his best friend. He didn’t love her. I’m sure many of us have had crushes that didn’t like us back and when they told us, they like someone else we helped them and didn’t sabotage them. This is the first time I’ve seen someone who says that they love someone else and completely sabotage them. He gave her horrible advice because he knows how gullible she is and she followed it. And his performance made it so easy to disconnect from the movie.

Milly has to be an idiot. I understand what she’s coming from. That she’s never done this before and she really didn’t know how to get about it. But man, she should’ve known that something was up at that love doctor. She should’ve known that her best friend was being weird every time she talked about Billy. I mean, how can someone be that naïve and that oblivious. And I could understand it’s probably because she didn’t have a mom to teach her these things, but she had television. She had books and her first thought was to go to a love doctor. 

Lastly , the actor that played Billy can’t act for crap . And felt so uncomfortable and unpleasing watching him act. My gosh, it’s like you can see that he’s trying to show emotions on his face, but it feels like you’re watching a horrible version of Disney Channel. And his performance made it so easy to disconnect from the movie. Why is this guy so gosh darn perfect? The key to make uncompelling character isn’t to make them perfect it’s to make them human. And I guess he was kind of human when he left their date angrily, but he eventually came back.

In other words, people are seeing the Tusk and not the Human behind them. Let me explain. 

This is a movie that gives the viewer the opportunity to experience the existential idea that animals and humans aren't so different. That there are people behind the ""Tusks"". By witnessing his girlfriend and best friend cheat on him, we're seeing one of the lowest points of civilized humanity. An emotional kill. 

Howard was rescued by an animal. Something he never even considered. Something most of us only fantasize about. Our pet rescuing us from a fire, proving that there's SOMETHING, rather SOMEONE, behind those eyes (Tusks). 

At the end of the film Wallace's transformation is complete and he is now a walrus. When his friends come to meet him all he can do is moan and eat fish because he's been broken. Physically, mentally, and is now an animal. Or is he? Is there something or someone behind the TUSK(s)?

Are we supposed to believe that that short amount of training completely broke him? Or is it possible that he just lost the ability to communicate effectively? It's left ambiguous. 

Look at your cat, dog, rabbit, walrus, and ask yourself. Is there someone behind the Tusk?",7,0

NON-SPOILER reasons why I called it unorthodox:

- Classic 80s new wave band *Wang Chung* created the score for this William Friedkin action thriller. This remains to this day the only feature-film score they've done. Extra fun fact - try to guess who the first choice for the score was (allegedly)? &gt;!Miles freaking Davis!&lt;.

- For once, the obligatory sex scene doesn't only feature female nudity. Yes, he hangs dong is what I'm saying. Fair play.

- They basically throw out the notion of ""we follow the hero of this story"" *fully out the window*. Without going into spoilers, it's not even presented as a moral dilemma, it's straight fucked up, but in a fiercely entertaining way.

- The villain is not the cliche shadowy figure that neo-noirs usually employ, but rather a complex &amp; layered character.

- The cold open is maybe even more insane than the actual plot, but is never once adressed after they move on.

- Due to its small budget, Friedkin ended up casting no-names for the leads. And who are those, you might ask? William Petersen, Willem Dafoe and John Torturro.

I think it's partly from the zeitgeist of the era coming out of Vietnam and Watergate and just the worldwide political strife and the general paranoia of atomic warfare and communism and just everything.  But that there's also that old school grittiness that pervades the filmmaking.  John Frankenheimer and Sidney Lumet that film searing movies!

Like The Conversation.  watching this on its own right is awesome and sequences like when Caul is listening in on the recording and putting it all together.  It's mesmerizing and you're just drawn in, hearing little bits and mentally assembling it in conjunction with Gene Hackman.  And then all the paranoia and conspiracy bits and then the upsetting moments as we near the denouement.  It's amazing, but it's even more interesting when taken among its cohort of films b/c there's so much that it has in common with the films of that time and a lot of that energy is not unique!

I recently watched The Parallax View and just the attitude about assassinations was insane.   

7 Days in May was amazing and I noticed it was written by Rod Serling!  But the idea of a president deemed weak by the armed forces AND the general public because he was willing to sign a disarmament treaty and that the military would prepare a coup is like crazy, but like so interesting.  

I just watched Robert Redford in The Candidate and that was a different sort of awesome and thrilling, but more in an inexorably subversive fashion.  Like we seem to be rooting for him to win the senate seat as the underdog and well intentioned newcomer, but by utilizing the means to win does he just become what he was battling?  the end is like so reflective of so much of the cynicism of many of the films of the 70s.

A big advantage for me is that they often include scenes and/or dialogues that are missing in the finished film. Quite often, even open questions are answered or apparent plotholes are closed.

Two small examples: How does Indiana Jones manage to travel with the submarine? The script and the novelization based on the script reveal it. Or: Why does Evelyn wake up tied to an altar at the end of the movie *The Mummy* (1999) after going into the underground vaults with Beni and Imhotep in the previous scene? This question is also answered by the script and the novelization.

In a way, I consider scripts as a kind of 'Extended Cut.'

It is important for me to note that I am not claiming that reading a script replaces watching a film. I am also aware that scenes or dialogues are often changed, improvised, shortened, or expanded on set. And I know that a film that incorporates all the dialogues or scenes from the script in full length might potentially be too long or drag at certain points; however, I am excited when I can learn more about the characters and the plot in this way.

Apologies if I sound ignorant I’m just genuinely curious about this 


Because for me 

1. I don’t watch movies based on the press tours or interviews, I choose to watch a movie based on it the trailers good or if I trust the director/writer who made it. And I’ve never seen anyone say they chose to watch a movie based on a press interview they saw about it. 

2. A lot of interviews I see don’t even rack up that amount of views. Outside of doing press interviews on the movie premieres, talk shows or on GMA, most of the other interviews I see don’t even rack up that much views. Some of them I see average like 40k views  or less than that even. 

3. And what’s the point of doing them if most of them are asking the same questions? Like I can’t even count the amount of times I’ve seen Austin butler tells the same story about how he got the Elvis role. He told that story in damn near all the interviews.  Same for Sasha Calle for her supergirl debut in the flash.  It’s to the point I’ve seen people make compilation videos of actors basically saying the same thing in different interview ",21,0

Fuck off, Oppenheimer. Move aside, Poor Things. Don't call us, Flower Moon, we'll call you. And respectfully get in line right behind GMO, Across the Spider-Verse. Bow to the real king. Bow, ya shits.

Godzilla Minus One is thrilling, devastating, visually glorious, but that's not the best part of it. The best part is the human drama, which is usually an afterthought in these movies. In this one, it shines.

The characters are so well-written and relatable, and the performances were fantastic. It dealt with some heavy subject matter without letting it bog down the narrative. 

Taking place just after WW2, the script really leans into the literally defeated psyche of Japan at the time. There's strong anti-imperialist sentiment against both Imperial Japan and the United States, and I just ate that shit up.

And then we get the Godzilla scenes themselves, and the CGI is second to none. CGI in general has gotten lazy yet busy in recent years, often trying to cover up the lack of quality by overwhelming us with volume. Not this movie, though. I wouldn't quite go so far as to say it looks realistic, we *are* talking about a kaiju movie after all, but it's really freaking close.

The action scenes are WILD, executed to perfection with gradual build-ups before all hell breaks loose. The stakes feel real, and the devastation hits like a gut-punch. It's a monster movie, but it's also a very human one.

Seriously, unless you're someone that hates kaiju films (*cough* weirdo) then I can't see how anyone can NOT love this film. It's nothing short of cinematic ecstasy.

*Let me add that the only major film from 2023 I haven't seen yet is The Boy and the Heron, so let's add a tentative ""so far"" to this post's title",289,821
movies,t3_1cjb4kn,1714749218.0,/r/movies/comments/1cjb4kn/ghostbusters_2016/,t2_dioe3me3,Discussion,Ghostbusters (2016),"I have done wrong by the Ghostbusters franchise. I aloud the petulant children of the internet stear me away from a great, well good, movie for too many years. 

I was born in 1985 and have been a Ghostbusters fan since I can remember. The movies are some of my favorites, I loved The Real Ghostbusters, and I ate up any merch I could get my parents to by me. My young life was all about two things, Ghostbusters and The Turtles. Which I still to this day have not grown out of.

I like everyone else want a third movie more than anything. I had heard over the years Bill Murray was being a Hollywood d-bag and was too go to do a third movie. Even though Ghostbusters was one of, if not his biggest, movies. So after years we got a sub par video game. Which was dubbed the 3rd movie or as close as we would get to it. Then in 2016 it was finally going to happen. A new Ghostbusters movie was coming out. The catch was it would be a new cast of Ghostbusters. Now let me clarify I never cared that they were get women to play the Ghostbusters. I only cared that they weren't the original Ghostbusters. Just like I never like the second animated series Ghostbusters Evolution. They weren't ""my"" Ghostbusters. Anyway the internet shit on the cast like no other. Then the movie came out and the assault continued. The movies a mess, the actress have no chemistry, Paul Fig doesn't understand what the Ghostbusters are about, basically the movie is not good or even worth watching. So me not wanting to watch something make a mockery of what I love, decided not to watch it.

Flash foward to today. I see that Ghostbusters (2016) is on Tubi. I figure why not give it a try? If I don't like it I can shut it off and I'm not out anything. Turns out I loved it. Literally everything I saw online was wrong. I know, go figure right? Now here is where my opinion my differ from others. I'm not trying to fight or start anything. I just feel this movie is do more respect than it has gotten. I generally think Ghostbusters (2016) is all around a better movie that Ghostbusters: Afterlife. I also think the franchise would have been better of continuing 2016 than trying to pick back up on the original movies. I will admit that I haven't seen Frozen Empire.

So why do I think 2016 was better than Afterlife? Let's start with 2016. It was a fresh start, they didn't need to acknowledge the original movies because it was a different universe. Yet they still gave plenty of nods to them. They introduced tons of new weapons and new enemies. The cast was fun and you could tell they loved working with each other. Also the pacing was real good. So many movies now days have to be 3 hrs long with 45+ minutes that are so dull you almost fall asleep.

Now about Afterlife. First Afterlife isn't a bad movie, I enjoyed it. That said for being writen/directed by the original director's son it has some flaws. My biggest problem with the movie is that they basically act like Ghostbusters 2 didn't happen. I know Ghostbusters 2 had lots of problems but like it or not it's part of the franchise. You can't continue on and pretend it didn't happen. They should not have put so much of the weight on Finn Wolfhard. He is a horrible actor, he doesn't know how to show emotion or deliver a line to save his life. I like Stranger Things but have never thought, man I hope this guy takes off I need to see more of him. Speaking of seeing more of someone. Why the hell do the Ghostbusters fighting Gozer again? The writer really couldn't come up with someone new? Gozer had already made two appearances in the franchise, if you count the game. The cartoon had no problem never using them and making fresh enemies for the guys to go up against. Lastly it's honestly too serious. Not completely serious, just not that classic Ghostbusters fun.

Again I'm not saying I hated Afterlife or would give it a bad review if a friend asked about it. I just truly feel 2016 is a better movie though. It was more fun and in the spirit of the classic movies. I am looking forward to watching Frozen Empire. You can bet as soon as it's on a streaming service I use I'm watching it.

Side note: I had heard that 2016 had given a name to the ghost on their logo. Rowan is not the ghosts name. Rowan took the form of the ghost. That would be like saying the Stay Puffed Marshmellowman's name is Gozer. No, they just took the form of the Stay Puffed Marshmellowman.

I can see why. There's no raids on buildings or anything. Just action. And story. That's it. 

However, it does build upon the last film. It follows the same person. And I kind of liked that, but wouldn't it better to have another big raid with another main character? They could have referenced the main character as a story progression type thing. 

I think personally it would perhaps. When I was watching it at aged 15, I was watching it with my family, and they got tired or it was past my bedtime or something like that. My father watched The Raid Redemption with me a year prior and I thought it was a great film. Then, he said that there was a sequel in the works, and I was hyped!

So, we had to watch it in two parts. I'm rewatching it for, I think, the third time, and it is a good sequel, but there's no raids, just the police officer being in jail, and then out of it and put into a gang. For his police work for the massive raid he had just done and to discover corrupt cops. 

I mean, okay. But it's called ""The Raid"" 2. He does, to be fair, beat up and kill lots of people, and that is cool. But do you see what I mean? I'm not sure what to call it. It is a good sequel, don't get me wrong, but it could have been better. In my opinion anyway. ",34,0

Anyways I just found out that Ryan Gosling and Derek Cianfrance are not going to be a part of Wolfman anymore. 

The previous news was that Ryan Gosling was supposed to be cast as the Wolfman and Derek Cianfrance was supposed to direct the film. 

I was really excited when I first heard about this because these two were involved in making The place beyond the pines &amp; Blue valentine. Both staring RG and had DC as director. 

These movies were genuinely really good and Place beyond the pines was really one of my favorites ever. It was such a good movie. 

Unfortunately (at least unfortunate for me..) those two will be replaced with Christopher Abbott &amp; Leigh Whannell. 

I don’t have anything against this actor and director but I was just excited to see what the original cast and director would be able to produce as their backgrounds held some pretty interesting work and mellow but greatly impressionable movies. 

Now it just seems like the new actor is just good enough for horror and same with the director. Which is a bummer because it’s just too much of a safe choice. That it leaves no room for me to be excited or anticipate anything. I’m sure it’d be good, but just not interesting or new.

It is this, but that’s an oversimplification and doesn’t do it justice.

The film opens with a woman showing up to a rental home at night in the pouring rain, and right from the get-go, the film draws you into a sense of dread with a menacing shot of an otherwise quaint, cozy home.  Upon learning that there is in fact someone already there (a young man claiming to have rented the place as well), the woman looks at other options and when she learns there is none takes up the man’s offer to stay the night there instead of sleeping in her car.

I’m sure plenty could argue the opening story line is implausible itself, but all things considered the characters really do a great job portraying realistic people in a scenario where neither has done any wrong and want to try and make the best of the situation.

Now, WHY I think this movie starts off so great- both characters are portrayed in such a way that you feel as though you’re trapped in a see-saw horror-romance film.  When seeing the world through the eyes of the woman, you can sense the fear that this man could legitimately be setting her up to trap her there and commit heinous acts.  She doesn’t know him at all, and despite his good natured disposition, he very easily could be a serial killer for all she knows.

The man, when viewing the situation through his eyes, mostly recognizes that the woman is apprehensive about staying there with him, but he knows that HE is a good guy and isn’t going to try and murder her, so why not make the most of a weird and awkward situation and just hang out and be respectful adults?  

This back &amp; forth continues for the first half of the movie, and the tension just continues to ratchet up higher and higher, with the question of whether this guy is the bad guy or just as confused as she is about what’s going on.  It’s masterful at this point up until the reveal, which to be honest I found a bit disappointing.

The second half is also very well done, but IMO loses some steam.  Justin Long plays a very well crafted character- one who views himself as a victim (we find out he’s been fired for inappropriate behavior with a female coworker), but there’s reason to think he might just be someone who made a bad decision and is a *good person deep down.

JL's character is also drawn to this house like the other two, so there’s a bit of continuity in that the film’s atmosphere centers around well written characters, but the story loses me when the villain is exposed.  The creeping horror remains throughout the film, but I was really hoping the two original characters kept pulling us deeper and deeper into the schizophrenic genre-melding see-saw between horror and romance (though admittedly less romantic than horrific).

JL’s character does expose a level of delusion and perhaps self-awareness not often seen in movies, but it’s not enough to rescue the second half of yr movie.

I would definitely recommend this one.  What it does well it really does well, but unfortunately the plot couldn’t match it.

*it’s been more than a few weeks since I’ve watched this one, so forgive me if my memory of this character is a bit off.",372,1608

Example: movies have been referencing the Godfather for decades. The most recent I've seen was in Disney's Zootopia. Sure it wasn't totally out of the left field in the movie, but I'm finding myself thinking ""for goodness sake, reference something else for once!""

I get it, Godfather is a great movie. But I would have hoped as other great movies are released, and new filmmakers who grew up on those instead got into the industry, you'd get a rotation of references.

Other movies that apparently are never going to stop being referenced: Braveheart (""Freeeeeeedom!"") and Scarface (""Say hello to my leetle friend!"")

Not an especially original premise on its own, but I think what they do with it is really nice. Chris Evans plays a very weak telekinetic guy living in the slums of Hong Kong to try and stay under the radar. He's more or less succeeding at this, until the government agency and a teenage girl with precognition (Dakota Fanning) find him and pull him into a struggle to recover a drug that can dramatically enhance a person's powers.

One of the things I love about the movie is how relatively small-scale it is. Dakota Fanning is trying to get the case with the drug in it because there's a chance she could help her mother, who's been in captivity for years. Chris Evans doesn't have any chance of destroying the government agency that's after him, he's not going to decide the fate of the world, he's probably not even going to be able to stop living on the run and under the radar. For our characters, the stakes are life and death for either them or their loved ones, but cosmically, this is just a tiny power struggle playing out in the backstreets of a world that's indifferent to it. It's sort of like the science fiction version of urban fantasy. Urban sci-fi? Low-fi? Whatever it is, there were several movies in the mid 2000s that were in that vein (Jumper is another), and it's something I wish I saw more of. 

A lot of the character interactions are really strong, particularly with Chris Evans's and Dakota Fanning's characters. She's a kid looking for help but she's also fairly jaded, he feels the need to protect her, but he's not old enough to be a father figure and is more like an older brother who'll watch out for her but still be kind of a dick to her. Both of them give really strong performances, and Djimon Hounsou brings a lot of weight to the villain as well.

The world of Push has a lot of different powers, 'stitches' who can heal people, 'watchers' who can see the future, 'sniffers' who can track people from their belongings. People have the power to influence other people's minds or their perceptions, and the movie makes really clever use of this, having the characters work through how to beat someone who can see their future actions in a way I've never seen before (I won't spoil it, but I think it's really cool). They use misdirection on other people and consequently the film can use misdirection on the viewer as well, making you question whether what you've been told or what you've seen is real or not.

Now, I've given this movie a lot of praise, but I don't think it's a criminally underrated masterpiece. It's got some flaws; Chris Evans's character is really bad with his powers. That's an important point and that's how he starts out the movie, but at the end he just sort of isn't anymore. There wasn't any time spent on him practicing his powers or learning anything about them, he's just magically stronger. Maybe they could have done a training montage that would have at least justified it, or have him end up taking the drug that enhances powers, or, what I would have really liked and I think would have been in keeping with the rest of the film, have him still be really weak, but find a clever way to use his limited power in an unexpected way. Another weakness is Chris Evans's love interest (played by Camilla Belle), who we just don't have enough knowledge of to feel any investment in their maybe-relationship. There's a reason for that and it facilitates some very clever moments, but it causes a pretty big portion of the emotional heft of the movie to not exactly fall flat on its face, but maybe to sort of stumble and land mostly comfortably if unimpressively on its ass.

So I've written a bunch of words about a not-much-talked about medium-budget science fiction film from 15 years ago that I admit isn't incredible. Why? Because even though it's not incredible, I do think it's good. There's strong performances, some good characters, a fairly unique vibe and some very clever ideas. I don't know if you'll love it, but there's a good chance you might like it. Check it out if you have the time.",12,26

in austin powers in goldmember, it's revealed that austin and his arch rival dr evil(who is a parody of james bond's ernest stavro blofeld) are actually long lost brothers. it's as ridiculous as everything else in the trilogy but still pretty humorous.

then, along came spectre, a film that was extremely hyped up for bringing back bond's old arch nemesis blofeld. yeah, you can probably already tell where this is going. turns out that bond and blofeld are half siblings.

Low-key? Unhyped?","I love me a good set of Hollywood summer blockbusters. Yeah, they're shallow and bombastic and melodramatic, but they're fun.

But this year just seems to be kind of....meh?

At least, based on the movies here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_2024

Like, starting in May till the end of September:

* Turtles All the Way Down
* Fall Guy
* Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
* IF
* Furiosa
* The Garfield Movie
* Bad Boys: Ride or Die
* Inside Out 2
* A Quiet Place: Day One
* Despicable Me 4
* Twisters
* Deadpool &amp; Wolverine
* Borderlands
* Alien: Romulus
* The Crow
* Beetlejuice
* Transformers One

First off, there are decidedly fewer Marvel movies this year, which is fine with me. Also, none of the traditional big franchises that have dominated the last 20 years have anything (no Harry Potter/Fantastic Beasts, no live action Transformers, no Fast &amp; Furious, no Star Wars, etc.).

But also...there are a lot of sequels/revivals/remakes of seemingly random franchises from the 90s (and/or late 80s, if we're being technical), for some reason? The Crow, Bad Boys, Twisters, and Beetlejuice? Netflix is even getting Beverly Hills Cop 4. Are these drumming up ANY excitement?

And the rest seem pretty understated, especially compared to the mega-franchises of past years. Obviously Planet of the Apes, Furiosa, and Deadpool are the big ones. Maybe Inside Out 2, as well. A Quiet Place is great but it's not what you'd call a traditional summer blockbuster. And Borderlands and Alien: Romulus COULD be great....but we've hardly seen anything of them, and the last few Alien movies haven't exactly lit up a firestorm of excitement.

I dunno, maybe I'm just not paying that much attention this year, but when I remembered it was already May I realized that I had not thought AT ALL about what movies I was looking forward to this summer, and when I tried, I couldn't really think of any until I looked at Wikipedia.

Am I the only one who thinks this summer is going to be a pretty low-key one? Not necessarily bad, because I'm looking forward to enough of these movies that I'm now getting excited, but I don't see any of the typical movie fanbases in this year's lineup, and other than Dune 2 (which already passed), I don't see another big franchise catching on with the mainstream and developing a large following.",8,0

My question is, what power is Tarantino trying to dispel that he thinks the Manson family holds? I'm pretty sure everyone already hated them and considers them bottom of the barrel dirty hippies.

Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. I just don't see how the ending does anything other than rewrite history for fun. It's not like I went into it thinking The Manson family members were anything but losers. I didn't watch the ending and think yeah now they're really humiliated! I already thought they were worthless buffoons.

Edit: If like to add that I am in my forties and very aware of the impact Manson has had, and I still stand by my claim that no one was ever giving power to the killers. An interest in a cultural even doesn't mean you're giving power to those involved. In fact, by making this movie, it's just going to stir up more interest in what really happened.

First off, I want to compliment Jared Hess for keeping something I also saw in his previous film, Napoleon Dynamite, which is unfiltered pauses. I’ve noticed in a lot of recent films that pauses/silence are edited. It could be background music, or it could be making the scene completely silent, including removing nonessential background noise. I’ve never liked that, and I was glad to see it go largely unused. It makes dialogue feel more authentic.

However, there are a lot of things the film could have done better. Throughout the 1st two acts, most of the jokes fall flat. I’m not a fan of the unnecessary awkward romance between Nacho and Encarnacion. A lot of the fights feel a lot less one-sided than they should, considering the lack of skill in both Ignacio and Steven. However, somehow, in the 3rd act, everything goes right. The final match feels just as equal as the others, but it’s earned. All the jokes at least somewhat land. Even the ending feels strangely correct (though Ignacio not being exiled from the church makes no sense).

Overall, I’m glad High Fidelity was actually Black’s big break, because this film is flawed enough that he’d likely be left in the dust. Hess tried to replicate his first film’s success and didn’t succeed. I give it a 5/10.",12,0

Also, What Did You Think?","I've just finished watching this Greek psychological horror film. I thought it was powerful, and of course incredibly dark. The director dealt with the horrendous (and unfortunately very realistic) subject matter with a sincerity, courage, and cruelty combined with compassion that I rarely see in movies.

So first of all I wanted to ask what did you think about it.  
Second, and here comes the SPOILER -

how would you interpret the ""Lock the Door"" ending?  
I read three possible interpretations, and I couldn't really decide for myself which one resonates with me:

1. The grandmother intends for all the remaining family members (including herself) to commit suicide.
2. The grandmother will now take the place of her husband, and the abuse will continue.
3. The grandmother and Eleni will secretly dispose of the body, making sure that the younger children will not spill the beans on what they've seen.

Which of these interpretation resonates with you? Alternatively, do you think the ending meant something different?",2,6

From Wikipedia, ""In March 2011, it was announced that Leone's original 269-minute version was to be re-created by a film lab in Italy under the supervision of Leone's children, who had acquired the Italian distribution rights, and the film's original sound editor, Fausto Ancillai, for a premiere in 2012 at either the Cannes or Venice"".

""The restored film premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival, but because of unforeseen rights issues for the deleted scenes, the restoration had a runtime of only 251 minutes. However, Martin Scorsese (whose Film Foundation helped with the restoration) stated that he was helping Leone's children gain the rights to the final 24 minutes of deleted scenes to create a complete restoration of Leone's envisaged 269-minute version. On August 3, 2012, it was reported that after the premiere at Cannes, the restored film was pulled from circulation, pending further restoration work"".

In my opinion, I think Once Upon A Time In America is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, with its beautiful musical score by Ennio Morricone and Masterful direction by Sergio Leone. Robert De Niro and James Woods also give their best performances in this film.

I love both the 229 cut and the 251 cut that was release on DVD, but I do wonder what the status of the 269 Cut is and if it will ever be release.

All in All, Will they ever release the 269 minute cut of Once Upon A Time In America?",10,7

They've worked together quite a few times and their scenes together are always golden. So I started watching more of Harvey's movies and I've been blown away by his performances. He's the type of actor that makes a movie better just by being in it. I checked out his imdb and he's been in A LOT of movies. I want to review the movies I've already seen here but I'd also like recommendations on some others I should check out. 

Reservoir Dogs ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

I immediately liked this movie after I first saw it. I've seen it a few times since and it gets better with each viewing. I think, so far, this is the best performance Keitel has ever given. His chemistry with Tim Roth is incredible. The acting and the dialogue really make the movie. And the non linear fashion of the storytelling makes this movie an unforgettable experience. One of Tarantino's best.

The Piano ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The music is the first thing I noticed about this film. It's hauntingly beautiful and makes this movie unforgettable. Obviously the acting is incredible all around. The eroticism is very well done. I knocked a star off because I wanted more backstory on Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel's characters. Also I thought the end happened kind of quickly.

Pulp Fiction ⭐️⭐️⭐️

I'm probably the only person in the world who isn't in love with Pulp Fiction. I've only seen it once so it may grow on me, but first impression is that I wasn't thrilled by it. Maybe I'm not used to movies that are comprised of many interconnected stories, but it just came off as random to me. I didn't care for Bruce Willis' character's story. I enjoyed the dialogue between Sam Jackson and Travolta and there is a certain charm to the film. I loved Harvey's Wolf character. I love how he can make a character with so little screentime so memorable. The acting is great overall and it's certainly a unique film.

Taxi Driver ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

Already reviewed Taxi Driver on my De Niro movie post but wanted to add that Keitel dominates the few scenes he's in and plays one of his most memorable characters to date perfectly. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time.

Falling In Love ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Already reviewed on my De Niro movie post. Standard love story between De Niro and Meryl Streep. Keitel is barely in it, but does well in the scenes he's in. Overall a sweet simple movie.

Holy Smoke ⭐️⭐️

I watched this movie because it was directed by the same woman that directed The Piano. I enjoyed that so I thought I'd enjoy this. Wrong. This movie has very strange comedy that feels out of place. The scenes with Keitel and Kate Winslet start off great then the movie morphs into something else completely. The end makes very little sense. I gave it 2 stars for the performances of the leads. I actually really enjoyed Keitel's performance. I just wish the movie had lived up to it.

The Two Jakes ⭐️⭐️⭐️ and a half

This movie is a long awaited sequel to the classic film Chinatown. I enjoyed Chinatown and was looking forward to seeing the sequel. I've read many negative reviews for this movie and I was curious how I'd feel after seeing it. I actually enjoyed the film. It's no Chinatown, but it's interesting to see an older Jake Gittes. I thought the movie needed editing as there are some unnecessary scenes in it. But I enjoyed Harvey's performance, his chemistry with Jack, and his emotional breakdown scene at the end of the film. I didn't see the twist of the film coming so it made me appreciate the film more. It's hard to make a worthy sequel to a classic like Chinatown but I appreciated this movie for the attempt.

Little Nicky ⭐️⭐️⭐️

This is a very silly Adam Sandler comedy that I grew up watching. Since I've become a fan of Harvey's, I decided to rewatch the film and pay close attention to his performance as Satan. He does great and looks like he's having a good time. You can't expect much from a story like this one, and maybe it's the nostalgia in me, but I always enjoyed this film. I used to watch it with my brothers when I was a kid and I find it just as funny as I did then.

Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore ⭐️⭐️⭐️

One of Scorsese's earlier films. Harvey only has a few scenes but boy does he do a great job. He goes from charming to truly menacing in a short amount of time and he does it perfectly. He's probably the most memorable thing about this film. Overall I enjoyed the film but felt it dragged in the second half.

Finding Graceland ⭐️

Weird flick where Harvey plays a guy who thinks he's Elvis as a drifter and helps to emotionally heal the broken people who give him rides. Super forgettable movie. Harvey's performance was OK but maybe needed a little more charisma if he's going to play Elvis. But I don't think anything could've saved this movie.

From Dusk Til Dawn ⭐️⭐️

As a huge vampire lover I was surprised that I hadn't seen this movie in my youth. I was even more surprised that I didn't like it. Firstly this feels like 2 different movies. The first half is vastly different than the second half. Secondly while I found the characters played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino well acted, they were very unlikable. While I understand Tarantino's character is supposed to be a sick and evil bastard, by having Clooney's character still love and support him the writers make his character not much better. Weird for a main character to be that way. I found Keitel kind of underacting here and his character is pretty forgettable. As was Juliette Lewis. The movie also felt low budget and desperately needed some charm or comedy to offset the dark beginning of the film.

Cop Land ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Already reviewed in my De Niro movie list. Good movie with a great cast (Sylvester Stallone, De Niro, Keitel, Ray Liotta, and Robert Patrick).

Mean Streets ⭐️

Already reviewed in my De Niro movie list. Great performances by Keitel and De Niro but found the movie too low budget and didn't have much of a story. The end was good though. 

The Irishman ⭐️⭐️⭐️

Already reviewed in my De Niro movie list. Liked certain parts but felt the movie was too slow and de aging was distracting. Also really wish Keitel was in it more.

Little Fockers ⭐️⭐️⭐️ 

Already reviewed in my De Niro movie list. Keitel only has like two scenes in this movie but I thought he was funny and the movie was silly but made me laugh quite a few times. 

Bad Lieutenant ⭐️⭐️?

I've only seen the R rated version of this film. I hear that you need to see the NC17 version to appreciate it. But as it is I didn't really enjoy this film. The bulk of it is Keitel's character messed up on drugs. The raped nun story takes a backseat. But his performance is very believable and haunting. I'll review this one again when I've seen the full version. 

City Of Industry ⭐️⭐️ and a half

Simple action film. Keitel is badass and effective as an almost retired thief looking for revenge on the guy who murdered his brother on what should've been their last heist together. Keitel and Timothy Hutton as brothers have good chemistry together. Wish there was more scenes with them. The movie starts off promising but second half drags as he's looking for Stephen Dorff who plays the villain. Lucy Liu as a stripper and Elliot Gould as a loanshark is like the most random casting ever. But overall it's an OK movie if you want a simple revenge action flick and to see Harvey kick some ass. 

Red Dragon ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

As my one of my favorite films of all time is The Silence Of The Lambs, I've seen Red Dragon many times and enjoy it almost as much. I watched it recently and payed close attention to Keitel's performance. He's very believable as Jack Crawford and has great chemistry with Edward Norton's Will Graham. This is a great film that everyone should see, especially with a cast that includes Edward Norton, Keitel, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ralph Fiennes, and, of course, Anthony Hopkins as the infamous Hannibal Lecter. 

The Grand Budapest Hotel ⭐️⭐️

I'm not a big Wes Anderson fan so this movie isn't really for me. But the colors are gorgeous and the story is interesting. It's got an awesome cast and great acting all around. Keitel isn't in it much but makes the most of the few scenes he has. 

The Duellists ⭐️⭐️⭐️ and a half

This movie is simply stunning. It completely transports you to a different time. I heard that the dueling is some of the best you'll see in film and took the actors quite a while to practice. Those dueling scenes are some of the best scenes in the film. Even though it's called The Duellists I feel like the film mostly focuses on Keith Carradine's character. Wish Keitel was in it more and had more dialogue. But overall an enjoyable film.

Thelma and Louise ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

A classic film that I hadn't seen til recently. This movie needs no introduction. As old as it is it still holds up today. Keitel isn't in it much but does well in the scenes he's in. Even though I knew how it ended it still struck me as one of the most powerful endings I've ever seen. Great film.

The Last Temptation Of Christ ⭐️⭐️ and a half.

I was very curious about this film due to the controversy it received when it first came out. I'm not a religious person but I've seen quite a few Jesus movies due to my parents' religious nature. This is one of the most unusual Jesus films I've ever seen. While I know it's not based on the gospels, it would be nice if more of the dialogue felt closer to them. The lack of accents are distracting. I understand having Jesus be more human and having doubts and fears but I wish he had more power and inspiration to give to his followers too. He's a little too human in this. The nudity felt unnecessary but that's just my opinion. I actually found the last 40 minutes to be the best part of the movie. To have Jesus see what his life would be like if he didn't need to be crucified and seeing the aftermath of that decision is very powerful. Satan's role in the film is also very well executed. I feel Satan's involvement is missing from most religious movies. Keitel does great as Judas in a very interesting take on the character and his impassioned speech to Jesus at the end of the film is moving. Overall an interesting take on the Jesus story but wish it was more familiar in certain areas.

Smoke ⭐️⭐️

This movie received pretty positive reviews, but I think what people are really seeing is two excellent performances in a movie with a subpar script. The movie is comprised of multiple stories that interconnect. That's not a problem, but I find that most of these stories aren't focused on enough and don't have satisfying resolutions. As a result, I feel like I'm watching a movie that's half finished. I also found some of the dialogue to be hammy and better suited to a stage play. But Harvey Keitel and William Hurt are so natural and brilliant in their performances that they make the movie appear good. 


That's it so far. Thanks for reading. Remember to please leave some recommendations for more of Keitel's films and your thoughts on my reviews. I'll be editing this list as I watch more of his films. ",38,0

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6p1ooc/sigourney_weaver_looks_back_on_ripley_and/

From an interview on _Galaxy Quest_, Sigourney Weaver makes some interesting points about science fiction and even shows like _Star Trek_:

https://www.mtv.com/news/uoge5x/galaxy-quest-oral-history

&gt; Weaver: It's funny, considering my background, but I was never into science fiction. I liked “The Twilight Zone,” that's as close as I ever got. I thought “Flash Gordon” was stupid. I think “Star Trek” happened and I missed it. I was in the theater, and then suddenly I did “Alien.” Suddenly I was straddling two very different worlds. I'll watch “Star Trek” once in a while – look at those cheap sets! But I also love to watch it as a “Gwen,” watching actors giving dignity to an absurd situation, speaking Klingon. But every time I see “Star Trek,” I just see a lot of people dressed as shepherds. They're always medieval or something. I can't get by it. Whenever I flip past, that's the episode I see – a bunch of shepherds. It's the reason I never wanted “Alien” to go to Earth! You'd see the culture – a bunch of shepherds, ugh! The closest you get to Earth is in “Aliens” at the beginning, on the space station. And poor Burke, Paul Reiser, he's wearing that absurd collar. It just says FUTURE and it doesn't work. In “Avatar,” it's all military and on the ship, so it avoided all that. But I just felt “Galaxy Quest,” as a comedy, was such a love letter to all the insecure actors in the field who have done so many wonderful and somewhat under-appreciated projects, and even though “Star Trek” is very popular, it was very...specific.

The vibe of this era of unabashedly comedic and campy action-horror flicks influenced by silver screen Hammer classics, fairytales and comic books is absolutely unmatched. I’m putting together a watchlist, what are y’all’s suggestions? 


Some criteria (but don’t let it stop you) are classic horror or comic book inspiration, vaguely steampunk aesthetic, dark fantasy vibes, 5/10 or under critic ratings, complete disregard for period accuracy, and a surprising amount of A-list Hollywood heartthrobs of any gender on the docket, and, consequently, a hefty dose of bi panic. 

Already included are: 

Van Helsing 2004

The Mummy 1999 (and direct sequels)

The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen 2003

The Brothers Grimm 2005

Sleepy Hollow 1999

From Hell 2001

Bram Stoker’s Dracula 

The Brotherhood of the Wolf 2001

Queen of the Damned 2001

Blade &amp; Sequels 

Hellboy - special shoutout to The Golden Army, unmatched IMO

Pitch Black/Chronicles of Riddick



Honorable mention to:

The Sorcerer’s Apprentice 2010 (points for Nick Cage but not enough horror elements)

The Last Witch Hunter 2015 (extra extra points for being based on Vin Diesel’s D&amp;D character and nailing the vibe but not enough 2000s camp)

The confusion that it brings not knowing whom to trust or whose words to believe is extremely unsettling and frightening. I give it a ranking of 3.5/10.

- I read others points of view in a thread on Reddit. However no one mentioned this: I am curious as to why the director/ writer didn’t paint Sandra in a neutral light. In fact the way they showed her behaviour in a regular day in her life seemed completely aligned with the theory that she’s not a murderer. Her body language and manners were believable to me ( I am specifically referring to her life outside of the courtroom). Don’t you think if they wanted to imply the possibility that she killed her husband, they should’ve represented her more neutrally?

- I’m not saying we should rule out the possibility of her murdering Samuel. I actually think the end of the movie kinda suggested that she could be guilty. But I still wonder, why must the director/writer make everything about her so believable at first? I just don’t get it.

One of us will act like we've had a eureka moment and say, ""Oh, the (whatever) is a metaphor!""  It started out serious, where I'd point out a metaphor and then there would be silly or ham-fisted metaphor, and I'd say it more sarcastically as if it's so deep and I'm so smart for understanding.  Then it turned into even more of a joke where sometimes we'll call things a metaphor that aren't metaphors, like some random thing in the scene or action.  Usually the trick is to point out a fake metaphor to try to make the other person think it's maybe a legitimate metaphor.

Anyway, I'd like to talk about good or memorable metaphors that you've noticed.  One that always sticks with me is the eggs in Runaway Bride.  Julia Roberts changes how she likes her eggs based on who she's with because she adapts her personality to suit her partner rather than being herself.  So Richard Gere comes along to encourage her to figure out how she actually likes her eggs.  (Fertilized, am I right?)

I'm not saying it's the greatest metaphor ever, but it's so damn memorable and perfectly integrated into that movie with a perfect payoff.  So it's always the first thing I think of when I think of metaphors in film.

For those who are interested, it's about a pair of twins who uncover some dark truths about their mother's past after her death. It explores themes of trauma, the effects of war, and forgiveness. It also has all of Denis' usual dramatic flair: it moves slowly but the shot compositions, editing, and overall mood engross you in its story. If you liked Prisoners, you'll love this.

Exploring the protagonists’ romance and Tom trying to save Isabella’s life through these different timelines/realities - it’s just a cool concept executed brilliantly. The visuals are gorgeous and trippy, and the performances are really strong. The final sequence with future-Tommy in the spaceship-bubble getting engulfed by the dying star and learning to accept Izzy’s death was so powerful - I barely ever get emotional watching a movie but this one really did it for me. The underlying message of accepting your grief, and learning to let go really struck a chord. 

But the best thing about the movie is easily the score. Clint Mansell went beast mode on these tracks. Every track is just unbelievably gorgeous, managing to tug at your heartstrings and convey a sense of cosmic vastness at the same time. I’ve had the album on repeat on Spotify for days now.

I think Roy just took over completely and there WAS an Aaron at some point. Because at the end he just made it seem like he made it up to get his ass saved after he was caught. Thats my logical take here.

Also what was the motive of Roy to kill the Bishop? ""Hes a sick fuck"" ok? Anything else? What if he was appointed or made to kill him in some way?

And here comes my 2nd point. The DA. What in the hell is the point of the subplot with the DA? Martin (Richard Gere) literally gets him on the stand and presses him on his motive to kill the Bishop. And... its never mentioned again. ???

Was the whole point of the subplot a reason to tell why Martin did smth illegal as a prosecutor 10 years ago and it was this? When he dismissed the trial of the SA of a boy by the Bishop?

I just dont understand how any of this correlates to the main story of Aaron/Roy or Linda or the other kid who ran away. 

Are we supposed to believe the DA somehow made Aaron/Roy kill the Bishop or what? Im just so confused here about the ending.

The obvious example is any number of depictions of Satan or some other folkloric demon. I think the depiction of Satan in The VVitch was excellent, and one of my favorites. Obviously in literature, someone like Judge Holden would fall into this “evil personified” archetype even if he isn’t *explicitly* the Devil. I watched Where Evil Lurks recently and I think The Rotten in that were interesting examples of this.

I find this archetype of character very interesting because proper execution is on such a razor’s edge, wholly uncomplicated characters with largely inhuman morality aren’t typically very compelling and many of the most evil characters in storytelling still have human motivations of spite or self-interest.

It’s very hard to make a fundamentally, unabashedly evil character interesting, typically when implemented well these characters play in the margins of the story, manipulating and tormenting the more dynamic human characters and exposing their failings but rarely taking center stage themselves for more than a scene.

 1. Weather radar evolved from technology developed during World War II and this movie was made a couple years earlier.  Experiments in England had began in the mid-30s but were archaic and in black and white.  

2. This road is turning clockwise, but tornadoes spin counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. This clockwise spin occurs in tornadoes in the Southern Hemisphere. I think this proves that Dorothy landed in Australia which is exactly why its called The Wizard of Oz!!

In her mind, continuining the friendship would continue in giving Dorothy the impression she had a chance when it could never happen. 

I don't know, I'd assume Julie just saying she's straight and isn't into women would be enough, especially since Dorothy was apologetic. Of course the debate is meaningless since Dorothy is a straight male posing as a woman. 

It was a bit homophobic. Nevertheless, it was 1982, so it was the time, and I guess the stereotype was Lesbians were predatory. I suppose.",14,0

This film clearly predates *Before Sunrise* (1995) — which makes me wonder if it inspired Linklater in anyway.

Ultimately, I enjoyed how refreshing, simple, and realistic this film was. Starts with a cruel plot, builds on emotional intimacy and forgiveness, only to end with the harsh truths of life.

It crushed me when I saw Eddie throw her address out the bus window. But after his conversation with Burzin — it reaffirmed his beliefs of who they are at the end of the day: four buddies on a mission to define their manhood.

Out of the Furnace- a hidden gem in my opinion is about pain, so is the even better movie it often draws unfair comparisons to- The Deer Hunter.

Horror movies let’s keep to a minimum cause they’re an obvious choice, plus nowadays with these “elevated” horror movies that want to be clever like Scream, often have hidden meanings and metaphors for themes that their director might not be fully comfortable exploring what the filmmaker truly wants. They can become too obsessive and often their own worst enemies, but more often it’s the studios trying to control the creative process, which is not their job.

The performance was just so good that it's stayed with me for all of the years. I saw this movie in theaters as a kid with my father and it was dead silence during the Normandy invasion, but after Jackson got that first kill on the MG-42 gunner on the beach after 15+ minutes of the Allies getting wasted I remember everyone in the theater just going absolutely crazy and cheering. It was like being at a basketball game.

Then of course you have the scene where he takes out the German sniper through the scope. The final fight with him in the tower *still* gives me anxiety as he keeps dropping enemies and they just keep fucking coming. He even misses a shot or two as one of them is running which makes it feel more honest and realistic.

And then finally you have the fact that he's a left-handed shooter operating a Springfield designed for right-handed shooters. 

After the tank takes Jackson out I remember just having this overwhelming feeling of dread and sadness, even as a kid. The squad relied on him heavily,, he was the top performer, and I think killing him off was *essential* because that's the beauty of it - a strong, nearly perfect character who gets outgunned by a tank. 

Hats off to Barry Pepper who was pretty much an unknown at the time. I'm shocked he never did end up getting more big roles like the rest of the cast did because Jackson was *so good* of a character. 

This post was so much longer than I originally intended but I could go on and on all day about how much I love this movie.

","First off, I’d personally call my self a studio ghibli fan, nothing hardcore or too crazy into them but i definitely enjoy their movies a lot and have some fan memorabilia’s lol. So I’m not just hating to hate or anything. 

Although I love the studio’s films, I have to be honest that I keep forgetting the general stories of them after a while or like some parts that happen? As in they’re pretty forgettable…? I don’t have problems with other movies/anime’s tho. 

For example- I’ll watch a SG film and be stunned and mesmerized by it, loving the story and loving everything about it. But their movies seem so easily forgettable because I find myself forgetting certain parts or general aspects of the story, like a week or so after watching it. Unlike other favorite films/anime… which I can remember for a long time. 

It’s kind of weird though, idk if that’s due to the amount of weird / fever dream like elements that the studio implements in their films? Or possibly because there’s just soo much that happens during the movie’s story etc. 

I’ve seen most of studio ghibli films over the years and I still have 2-3 of them I’ve yet to see. 

My personal favorite movies is Spirited Away, Howls moving castle, Kiki’s delivery service. 

Although these are my favorites and they actually have made such big impressions on me to where I purchase a no face piggy banks or howl’s ring lol. I always tend to forget elements of the film or general story. 

I don’t hate it though… it actually makes me feel good about rewatching them as if it’s new because I forget certain big parts. But it’s odd because I’ve probably seen the movies 10+ times yet I still forget certain elements…. And it’s mainly only a studio ghibli thing for me?

Am I the only one who finds them forgettable?

If you think they’re forgettable too, why do you think that is?
My conclusion would be that the films always have so much going on both visually and in the story that it leaves you forgetting certain parts of the movie. Not to an insane level but just makes you clueless in some parts. But at that same time that makes me wonder is studio ghibli really as profound and exceptional as most people/fans would say or has it always lacked in creating a great story that lands a good memorable impression. 

It’s kind of like certain Nolan movies for me, movies like inception, tenet and Oppenheimer are all great but to me they’re easily forgettable for the most part. But then there’s movies like Batman trilogy, momento, interstellar and the prestige that’s also really great movies but you can remember pretty much everything. 

I’m not saying that only memorable movies can be great, but although I have my ghibli favorites, I do find some of his movies lacking to land the story with a good impression for some movies. Like Howl’s moving castle, nausicaa, princess mononoke,  the boy and the heron. Not saying they’re bad films, but I find it to be full of a lot of stories and subject matter, just screen pact full of different cool and fantastical things. But then lacks in having a particular wrap for all of it. So in the end there’s a simple “well that’s it” story wrap they have but it makes the rest of the movie seem kind of like a whole long big journey for something so small and simple? 

I’m up for any discussion or want to hear other’s opinions about this!",50,0
movies,t3_1chiznp,1714560073.0,/r/movies/comments/1chiznp/the_little_things_theory/,t2_78x09n94,Discussion,The Little Things Theory ,"So I decided to watch The Little Things three times over the course of two days to see if I could come to a point of certainty for my own sake. If I didn't try, I knew I was going to be giving the movie mental bandwidth that I would rather use on other stuff. 
I've decided, with a strong measure of conviction, that Sparma absolutely is NOT the killer based on the following:

1) The car that intimidates and pursues Tina Salvatore in the opening is a dark blue Mercury. At no point is that make/color vehicle tied to Sparma. 

2) The guy pursuing Tina is outright *SHOWN* on the screen, TWICE! Granted both times are for a fraction of a second, but it's long enough to be able to see his short sandy brown hair, sharp rather than round facial features and dark framed glasses. Long enough to see that it isn't Sparma scanning the desert scrub with a flashlight. 

 The rest of this is more speculative than the previous points. I think the killer does work at one or the other of the appliance shops. The landlady at Julie Brock's apartment seemed firm about having called ABC Appliance, so Deke figuring that she misremembered and actually called *AAA* Appliance ,while absolutely due diligence, should have been taken with a grain of salt. 
I acknowledge that Julie's address and name were in the log book at AAA, but maybe Jack Aboud was telling the truth about not being able to get to it for a while so the landlady cancelled with AAA and called ABC instead. If Deke had given as much energy and time to investigating whether the woman at ABC has a son or brother or spouse, whoever, that sometimes answers calls, maybe doesn't write stuff down sometimes, etc, would that have led us down a different path?

At AAA, his instinct - which we know by the end of the movie is just as fallible as anyone's - tells him this is where the shark hunts from... and maybe he's right. Sitting to the right of Sparma is a man reading a newspaper (I can't tell if it's an article about crime, but still), eating what looks like a roast beef sandwich and sipping from a thermos cup. Weirdly, the thermos itself is closer to Sparma than it is to this unnamed, possibly sharp-featured fella. This is neither here nor there, but it also looks like Sparma might be having PB&amp;J for lunch. I wondered if there was milk being kept cold in the thermos as opposed to coffee being kept hot?
Who would bring milk AND beer to drink at the same time to Julie Brock's apartment? Maybe two separate people. 
Sparma becomes aroused at the thought and sight of violence culminating in death. Not the first person I've heard of that is aroused by watching violence either on it's own or combined with sex, though obviously the killing is the most extreme iteration. That doesn't mean he's actively involved in inflicting any of those things,  violence, SA or the murders themselves, but maybe he's passively involved. He gets to watch his counterpart ""work"", he gets to ""play"" by moving and staging the bodies after. His cohort has someone to admire his ""work"", someone he can brag to about and relive the crimes with (might he share specific details that only he, the victim and maybe the police would know?), someone who can say ""yeah, he was with me all Saturday evening"", etc. Along with the police scanners in his apartment, that could account for Sparma knowing specific details, right? 

Whatever the pieces are, however it shook out, the fact remains that the guy chasing Tina through the scrub wasn't Albert Sparma. Does that mean Sparma 100% isn't a killer? 
Nope. 
More than one killer can be active in the same place at the same time. 
But the movie seems to want us to accept that Man Chasing Tina=Serial Killer We're Looking For. If that's the case then, for my own conclusion, at worst Sparma is a passive participant and sympathetic companion to the active killer. At best he's an odd creepy guy who delights in distracting detectives from doing their incredibly important stressful jobs, gets tumescent at the sight of women's corpses and doesn't know shampoo exists.

Either way, it may not be the ethical conclusion but I'm def not sad about the ending....

.... except for the possibility that the active killer will continue to actively kill.

(read the description),"I'm a student and therefore don't have a lot of money, but I'm also a movie buff so I've been thinking about getting a blu-ray player for quite some time. I would also have the money for the player and for 2 films but spending 200 euros is not something I can do without thinking about it and therefore I decided to make this post to get some external and probably more objective opinions. In reality, a little while ago I came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth it, also because the main reason why I wanted to buy the blu-rays is the fact that I want to support cinema (but also to be able to watch the films I want when I want without worrying which disappears from the streaming platform) and in reality I can also buy the films on Amazon in HD, this made me have several doubts about blu-ray, also because in general buying blu-ray costs more, so you might as well buy from Amazon, in the end I still support cinema (and the films remain in the catalog even if they are no longer on Prime video).

Everything changed when, after various searches, I found an article that talks about why it is better to buy Blu-rays and the guy talked about how Blu-rays are actually yours when you buy them, whereas if Amazon goes bankrupt tomorrow (which is unlikely but not impossible) or if it decides to change strategy and closes Prime Video (which is still unlikely but less so) all the films bought would disappear and if for example I had 1000 euros worth of films bought, they would all be wasted.

Unfortunately there are downsides to both things and I honestly don't know what to do. What do you think?",118,0

I was over joyed! We would get a chance to see the after math of how the war between the machines and humans. But instead we got nonesense, campy characters, telling the audience it’s like a video game, and unessary nostalgia scenes. It didn’t feel like the matrix movie we know, and yet some scenes even new technology references were. What I think the Wachowski sisters should have done was created a new protagonist that’s somehow connected to neo, keep its theme with new technology, and it will create a part franchise.

Neo body was pulled and taken away by the machine in the previous movie matrix revolution. It left the audience to wonder, what’s gonna happen to him? We could have had a new character leading the franchises that somehow in some way he was connected to Neo, getting vision and seeing the code. And Mouse would have contacted him, then get the latest backstory how the machine were attacking one another. Even find out later smith is back and trinity is alive.

The theme of Matrix resurrected was about how social media builds up energy in people twice as much power. The Analyst play by Neil Patrick Harris, explain how the human is easliy anguished. How everyone since computers today have been about media, and we get into arguments. This I thought was brilliant, how it relates today’s world. Including 3D printing organic foods. But also surprised how AI program can be set free too. This was unique for the film.

It had a chance to create a new franchise. Film one (as mention in the first paragraph) would had start out with a new character connected to Neo, meets Mouse then goes on an adventure. Movie 2, they would fine Neo, learn that smith or Merovingian has returned and behind everything, and learning trinity is alive. 3 finding trinity, fighting new war with the machines as allies.

They had an open opportunity what could have been. Instead what this movie felt like was a nostalgia niche WB was pulling. Nostalgia is nice WB or whoever was in charged used nostalgia as a niche for the film. We don’t need to be reminded, having seeing the matrix movies a thousand times. 

I hope they would redo it to save the franchise, even if it’s a pipe dream you never know.

Lots of controversy, criticism, whatever, it is entertaining from beginning to end. The great cast is hit-or-miss, but I blame Chevy Chase's energy for much of that. If they let Aykroyd play Chase's character like he wanted, the set vibes would've been a lot different. Also, we'd get to see Aykroyd, much of the draw, instead of only in that awful (in a good way) makeup.

Maybe Aykroyd needed reining in... He definitely needed it. But leave that Mr. Bonestripper bit alone. With the cartoonish lack of blood, that is some good comedy for our numb era if not for the pre-internet early nineties. And that actor's delivery of 'I plead the fifth dimension' is too good.

But one thing has always bugged me over the years. Beyond its many problems, one thing makes no sense. Not that Aykroyd is a great scriptwriter when he's left alone, but this is such a preposterous part of the movie I'm forced to assume a cut shot showing things being hidden. 

Are we supposed to accept that no one in the Digital Underground, including Tupac Shakur, or their entourage had any drugs or weapons? I mean, I take it as rap fan Aykroyd extending some of his big-name legitimacy to what was still a young genre in the pop music world, the irony of something like that. Aerosmith lent their name to Run DMC years before, but Digital Underground was a hard-core group, lyrics way beyond the mostly radio-friendly vibes of Run DMC. In this Aykroyd was ahead of his time, letting them do their own, not kid-friendly song instead of requiring them to write something clean and plot-related, like Ninja Rap...

This time, the final shot was oddly a gut punch for me: Looking out the car windshield toward the open road, as if Pink is “driving into the sunset” with his pals, but there’s no sun in sight. The horizon is gray, plain and not exactly the image of a hopeful future. Add in the fact that he’s saddled with degenerate stoners (and a girlfriend who he cheats on), Pink has clearly made a shitty choice about his future, and yet it doesn’t bother him. It just struck me as ironic that a film mainly remembered for its ~~punk-rock~~, rebellious playful abandon and cheeky one-liners wraps up in this one depressing yet moving shot that adds another layer to one of the main character’s actions. To be fair, it’s not the only conclusion for these characters - several of them end up with happy endings - but it was a thoughtful choice to leave us with that gray road as the final shot.

Edit: ""degenerate"" is perhaps a little harsh haha. They're a charming and lovable bunch, I just couldn't help but feel the contrast between Pink's potential and their lack of ambition. Either way, I love Linklater's depiction of this final moment, whichever way you interpret it!",11,0

My questions are: why couldn’t they just tortured Fausto’s location out of the first guy? If they couldn’t, what was the whole point about getting Alejandro over to Mexico through the tunnel? Why couldn’t they just get him to cross normally with some gear instead of risking a firefight with the cartel? Was it so that he could steal the cop car so that he could pull over the US based lieutenant? But how did they know the cop guy would be there at that exact time?

movies,t3_1ch8f9t,1714522991.0,/r/movies/comments/1ch8f9t/unthinkable_is_pure_propaganda_spoilers/,t2_6c4u8e8s,Discussion,“Unthinkable” is pure propaganda. (Spoilers),"I know, talking about a movie from 2010 is a bit strange, but I just saw it on Netflix and felt the need to share my thoughts and see what other people who saw it think. 

The movie has an interesting premise, how far are you willing to go to save innocent lives? Torture? Would you harm/kill innocent people? Children? 

The acting is great, the characters are sympathetic (for the most part… the wife of Samuel L Jackson having killed innocent women and children for revenge kinda felt weird to me, but whatever). They are gearing up for the big climax as time is running out, what’s the big moral of the story going to be? That torture doesn’t work? That sometimes you need to sacrifice part of yourself, even compromise your own morals for the greater good?

Nope. It’s “you should have let him torture the children”. 

To me it felt like a giant ad to justify the use of torture on prisoners and their families to get the information you need, using this one very specific set of circumstances to go “see? This is why we need to torture people!”, forgetting the fact that 99.9% of the situations the US government uses torture in are not at all comparable to the situation presented. 

Maybe I’m wrong, maybe it was trying to show that we are unwilling to make the hard choices because we put our own morality, our own purity above the lives of others, that sometimes it is actually selfish NOT to do the evil thing… But I can’t help but feel the message MOST people will take away from the film is that the US government tortures people for our own good. 

I think if maybe they had sprinkled in a few references to the fact that this is an extreme case, that most often torture is NOT the answer, then it would be more impactful. But the movie seems to go out of its way to make torture seem acceptable, and effective, with Jackson’s line that “if torture didn’t work we wouldn’t have used it for thousands of years” basically endorsing torture as an effective means of getting information. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, but did anyone else feel they missed the mark a bit?

Chase was the bad guy of the story. He was the other love interest (in addition Tate) of Kya, and he unfortunately turned out to be a scumbag and a rapist. Pretty bad.

But then again Kya got away with a *cold-blooded murder plot* (she killed Chase) and kept it a secret in apparent good conscience for the rest of her life. She let the people who helped her along the years (Tate and the couple with the store) believe that she was wrongly accused of the murder of Chase.

Objectively what Kya did was worse. Even if one could argue that murdering Chase was ""justified"" and something that Kya ""needed"" to do in order to survive. Right?",20,0

My theory is that Cooper feel into the Black Hole and ended up in the inner region where you can move freely around. The Tesseract that is there was not put there by ""future"" humans. Based on the theory in that Vertasium video, future humanity is really from a universe ""behind"" us. They sent a Tesseract into a black hole that we could interact with. Information cannot leave a black hole from the direction it came, it can only go forward. So Cooper is sending information to a parallel universe (the next one.)

I ain't prepared and i gotta rewatch it tomorrow but, It touched my because I had my ""Sam' in prep school and I was a wallflower too which i just knew the meaning of it :- ""someone who's so shy that they typically stand or sit alone rather than engaging with a larger group"", I didn't say anything to her even that it was obvious, then my Emma Watson aka "" Sam"" left us in Secondary stage, I felt like I won't be able to pass these 3 years and I'm not going to college.

first semester in 1st year, I got depressed, bad mood, more isolation even tho I had friends but I preferred to sit alone and imagine her coming back to see us at least, to experience once again how it felt to sit in class and be able look at her and just smile from the inside...

3 years in school and I may say I saw her 3 times ig how awful is life!!!! Somehow I managed to stay focused until I graduated, she joined us in our Prom after I convinced our School principal... The Story begins now, 2 nights before prom we are preparing the celebration hall or whatever you call it was so much fun, we talked and I felt love again..I thought this part died in me !

So PROM, I had one chance I can't fuck it up right &gt;? boom fun night but I couldn't tell her, I was so cloooseeee omg the way we talked and laughed, Now we are going to college a whole new experience I managed to get into civil engineering even though rn I wanna shift to film school and steal jeans from the mall..

I wanted to confess my love to her, my bf had an idea so that we can meet, it's so creepy but she loved it.. we were all one group so her friends told her we are going out and that I was coming but she didn't know that only me was going there XD.. we went out super nervous we talked and waited for our friends but guess what haha no one comes, so we talked remembered our memories in school together and how we are feeling about college, then boom I Love You, I felt free again for a moment nothing else matters.. I just wanted to get it out off my chest.  
as Patrick said ""I didn't think anyone noticed me "" but she did and We dated for a year and half what a lovely time every time I was with her I felt patrick when he said ""This is happening, I am here and I'm looking at her and she is so beautiful""...I really felt INFINTE

so happy ending is it ?

well long distance is a bitch, and we couldn't work it out in this period of life, we decided to wait for each other after college better than to waste a whole relationship.. I know it looks missed up but I can manage, it's been 8 months since we talked.. a whole year since we sit with each other.. now I'm about to finish my 3rd year in college, still has 3 more thinking about it makes me wanna vomit.. I wasted a lot my time not experiencing life, I gotta try things on my own and create whom I wanna be..

I will watch the movie again tomorrow and probably will have another opinion and it will reflect on another part of my story and I won't feel the blues after watching it.. We are who we are boyz

I can think of a good example like Toy Story. On Blu-Ray and 4K, the dated texture work is more apparent. The blur of DVD hides the crustiness of the various dated textures.

What about movies that have CGI special effects like the Star Wars prequals? Seeing stuff like Temuera Morrison's head being plastered on Commander Cody's body (CGI character) when he isn't wearing his helmet and Obi-Wan on Boga in Revenge of the Sith is so jarring on Blu-Ray and 4K because it's apparent the actors were green screened and edited in due to the higher resolution. The blurriness of DVD helps blend the actors and the CGI together.

Honestly just because certain movies and shows are in higher resolution doesn't mean it's better. In fact, with CGI it can make a movie or show display their age even worse because the flaws and aging aspects are more apparent whenever it's editing, polygons, texture work or make errors more apparent. I know it's still dated CGI, but at least stuff look less fake.

Apologies if this has appeared before or my formatting is off. This detail is new to me so here goes...

Bill Paxton's character Master Sergeant Farrell berates J squad for gambing, and sets up the time loop and Cage's journey perfectly:

&gt;FARRELL: Private Kimmel, what is my view of gambling in the barracks?  
&gt;  
&gt;× You dislike it, Sergeant Farell.  
&gt;  
&gt;FARRELL: Nance, why do I dislike it?  
&gt;  
&gt;x It entertains the notion our fate is in hands other than our own.  
&gt;  
&gt;FARELL: And what is my definitive position on the concept of fate?  
&gt;  
&gt;ALL (in chorus): Through readiness and discipline, we are masters of our fate.  
&gt;  
&gt;FARELL: You might call that notion ironic. But trust me, you'll come around.

I love the dual meaning in this speech. He's highlighting the irony of his statement given Cage's immediate situation (ie he has been press ganged into being on the front lines), while unknowingly foreshadowing the irony of the constraints of the time loop as Cage's ultimate means of defeating the mimics.

Putting it another way, Farrell captures the essence of the obstacle at the heart of the movie, where the mimic invasion and presumably catastrophic loss of life appears to be inevitable, and it's only through Cage's exhaustive practice and discipline - enabled by the restrictions of the time loop - that he finally has the tools to break out of the loop and choose his future.

Also I love ""you'll come around"", which is just on the nose in terms of Cage's experience of the time loop.

Great movie.",117,2073

When they slay a demon,  there is never any blood, on the weapons, or their clothing, or  anything. No splatter, nothing shown. When they dig the graves, they are  sweaty and dirty, but never bloody. However, when Fenton gets the  sheriff and the dad is forced to kill a man (not a demon) the blood is  everywhere. On the axe. On the fathers hands and shirt, even on Fenton's  face. It not only distinguishes the demons from the men, but may also  be another mechanic of their divine protection, as the father says ""when  we are God's hands, we cannot be seen"", or something to that effect.

I hope you are all doing well. I wanted to follow up on the recent update regarding the future of our community. Firstly, I want to express my gratitude to all of you who participated in the poll and shared your thoughts. Your input has been invaluable in shaping our next steps.

&amp;#x200B;

**Poll Results**

[Poll Results](https://preview.redd.it/0ljffg3tnf7b1.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=062ca2b7eee28adbc4f17b54fe54e4a3e1346b64)

Based on the poll results, it is evident that the majority of our community members believe in the importance of continuing the protest and taking a more substantial stand. However, we have since received communication from Reddit administrators that any subreddits going private will have their moderation teams replaced with new moderators who are willing to reopen their communities. This presents a challenge, as going private at this moment would render our efforts less effective in influencing change.

In light of this information, we have made the decision to remain public for now, ensuring that we can maintain our current moderation team and continue our advocacy within the confines allowed. However, I want to assure you that this is not the end of our protest. We are committed to fighting for the issues that matter to us as a community.

&amp;#x200B;

**Redesign, Relaxing Rules, New Mascot**

Over the next few weeks, we will be working on a complete redesign of our subreddit. As part of this redesign, we have made the decision to change our mascot and logo from Reddit's Snoo. This change is significant as it symbolizes our desire to move away from Reddit and explore alternative options for the future. We want to ensure that our community has the freedom to grow and evolve beyond any single platform.

Please see below for a poll on some mascot options we were thinking, we are looking for something endangered that we may be able to fundraise for in the future. 

 Additionally, we will be relaxing some of our rules to reduce the amount of work (free labor) we contribute to the subreddit and Reddit as a whole. Stay tuned for separate posts announcing these changes. 

**IPO Blackout Pact**

Now, let's talk about the exciting new pact we are looking to initiate—the IPO Blackout. With the impending IPO (Initial Public Offering) of Reddit, we see an opportunity to make a powerful statement as a collective. We invite other subreddits to join us in this pact, where we will go private and blackout our communities once again. By standing together, we can send a clear message that we demand transparency, user-centric policies, and respect for the communities that make Reddit thrive.

&amp;#x200B;

As we move forward, I want to express my appreciation for your continued support, passion, and dedication to r/Moviedetails.

Sincerely,

u/Shaneh7646 and the r/Moviedetails Moderator Team

We are pleased to announce that r/Moviedetails, along with many other subreddits, in the Detail Network r/TVDetails r/GamingDetails r/ShittyMovieDetails r/iwatchedanoldmovie and r/DetailCraft, will be reopening today with restricted access after a recent blackout as a form of protest. Initially, we had announced an indefinite blackout to bring attention to a critical issue affecting Reddit as a whole. However, due to recent developments and threats from Reddit administrators, we have decided to reopen while granting our community the opportunity to have a say in shaping our future course.

The blackout was in response to a concerning policy change by Reddit that threatens to eliminate beloved third-party mobile apps, depriving users of essential features and customizability. On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced a drastic increase in the price to access their API, effectively rendering third-party apps like Apollo, Reddit is Fun, Narwhal, and BaconReader unsustainable. [You can find more info here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MovieDetails/comments/1414hjo/rmoviedetails_will_be_going_dark_from_june_12th)

This policy change not only impacts mobile users but also jeopardizes other means of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite and the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface. Moreover, subreddit moderators heavily rely on tools available outside the official app to ensure their communities remain on-topic and free from spam.

Now, we turn to you, the members of r/Moviedetails. Your voice matters, and we want to include you in the decision-making process. We have created a poll to determine whether we should continue the protest or fully reopen our subreddit. Your vote will shape our next steps.

We would like to express our gratitude for your continued support and dedication to r/Moviedetails. Your passion for movies and attention to detail are what make our community thrive. Let's work together to improve the subreddit moving forward.

Thank you,

u/Shaneh7646 On behalf of the r/Moviedetails Moderator Team

During this scene, the song “In Ginocchio Da Te” (English: Kneeling in front of you) by “Gianni Morandi” was played. Being able to speak Italian, I understood what those lyrics meant and I was just SHOOK that they TOTALLY made sense to the scene on the screen. 

Let me elaborate: the song is basically about a man who cheated on his woman and now returns begging on his knees for forgiveness. AND THAT’S LITERALLY WHAT THE KIMS DID TOO. They betrayed the Parks (and therefore inevitably the former housemaid who lost her job), were exposed, realized their mistake and now are begging on their knees for forgiveness. 

To be even more precise when looking at the lyrics, it goes “ritornerò in ginocchio da te”. While this translated literally means “I will return kneeling in front of you”, you can also interpret/see it as the victory for the housemaid (“I will return/ritornerò”) as the housemaid did return, and now the Kim family are kneeling in front of her for forgiveness (“in ginocchio da te”). 

Now the second song I will analyze has even TWO Easter Egg meanings. It’s called “Mio Caro Bene (Rodelinda)” by Georg Handel. The first time we hear this song is when the rich mom goes grocery shopping with the poor father/chauffeur for her son’s birthday party and at the checkout she tells her friend on the phone that it’d be great if she could sing there, preferably a song she likes a lot that goes “mio caro bene, caro caro!” And then laughs. 

A few scenes later we do hear it being performed in their backyard by their friend, shortly before the party gets “interrupted”. 

Side note: The fact that the rich Park family is so familiar with classical music is just another detail that represents wealth (e.g. attending classical music performances is usually associated with rich people, just think of how fancy people are dressed there; the movie “The Intouchables” (2011) also makes a funny remark to this detail). 

“Mio Caro Bene” would be roughly translated to “my dear love”, although the word “caro” here is very interesting as it can have two meanings. One is “dear” and one means “expensive”. When I realized this, I thought of that scene where the Kim father/chauffeur talks to the rich Park father in the car who told him that his wife had to fire the housemaid. This is a problem to Park, as his wife is terrible at doing housework, to which Kim replies: “but you still love her, right?” and Park only laughs and says “yeah yeah, let’s call it love”. To me, it made me realize that he most likely married his (trophy) wife not out of love but as a status symbol who is (in return) attracted to his money. 

The second Easter Egg in the lyrics foreshadows/hints at what literally is about to happen next in the movie. The lyrics go “non ho più e pene al cor” which means “I no longer have pains in my heart” and we all know what fate Kim Ki-jung “Jessica” awaits in the next scenes. 

Truly astonishing which Easter Eggs hide in the music used. I thought it was just randomly picked as it fit well with the sound and overall aesthetic but clearly, Bong Joon Ho (the director) is a mastermind. 

Hope this was insightful to you! :)

Edit: I just noticed something that could possibly be ANOTHER Easter Egg. In the lyrics from “Mio Caro Bene” song, the line before the “I no longer have pains in my heart” goes “non ho più affanni e pene” which means “I have no more worries and pains” which could be a reference to the state of mind Ki-woo/Kevin is feeling when he wakes up from coma after the party incident. He’s just laughing (due to his brain surgery) and not taking anything serious, even the death of his sister. He’s completely without any worries and seemingly not in any (physical or mental) pain. 

Just like those two lines follow directly one after the other in the song, the closeness of the lines can represent the closeness of the relationship between the siblings.

Edit #2: I guess I just noticed ANOTHER Easter Egg in the song “In ginocchio da te”. There’s a line that goes “l'altra non è, non è niente per me”,  which means “the other one means nothing to me.” THIS IS JUST GENIUS. Because the housemaid was fired in an instant, despite her year-long loyalty to the family, therefore it is obvious that the former housemaid literally meant nothing to the rich mom. I love how this song was particularly used when the HOUSEMAID was the one who returned, exposed the fraudsters and had a short-term victory.",36,3096

The curator indirectly foreshadows how the contest will play out. (all clips in comments),"[Clip 1] Parzival (the protagonist) tells the curator that he is done watching the scene. The curator, whilst watching Parzival walk away, decides to leave the scene playing as a major clue is about to be revealed. This implies that The curator knows that the aforementioned scene is a major clue to the contest.

[Clip 2] Parzival says to Art3mis that he always felt that the biggest clue to the contest was hidden in the scene they were watching. The curator says: “You’re right”, before changing the context of his comment to the bet they made. 
Shortly after, Parzival says to Art3mis: “She [Keira] is the big mystery”. The curator then says: “No No”. Before then again changing to the aforementioned context. 

It is later revealed that the final secret to the contest was in the scene that Parzival mentioned, and that Halliday’s relationship with Keira is not a clue to the final step, but actually Halliday’s friendship with Morrow (both are relevant in the scene that Parzival is watching). 

This implies that The curator knows that Halliday’s friendship with Morrow is part of the ‘final clue’, despite the fact that no characters, or the audience, are supposed to know that the ‘final clue’ exists (there is a secret final test in the movie).

In clip 2 The curator also insists that Parzival takes his quarter, despite it being negligible to Parzival’s coin count.

[Clip 3] It is revealed that the quarter that The curator gave to Parzival is a token which grants an extra life. 

The fact that The curator insisted that Parzival takes the extra life implies that he believes Parzival will need it, as the next key is found through completing a dangerous challenge (although Parzival did not need it to obtain the second key), unlike the first key (a protected shortcut under the race) and the third key (the third key was only dangerous due to IOI sabotaging the competition, which is not in The curator’s control).

[Bonus theory] At the end of the film, it is revealed that The curator is Morrow, who created the oasis with Halliday, providing an explanation to how The curator knew all the clues to the contest. Despite this, Morrow says to Wade (Parzival’s human identity) that Halliday told Morrow nothing about the contest. This leads me to believe that Halliday did in fact NOT make the contest, and instead Morrow did to honour Halliday after his death, but I understand that this may just be a plot hole rather than a detail.",18,90

Deadline just published their biggest flops list for 2023 and 3 of the 4 DC films released were missing from the list. I estimated how much each movie lost for WB using the breakdowns from Deadline's list for other relevant movies (Mostly DC and other superhero movies). I estimate that Shazam! Fury of the Gods lost **$97.1M** for WB compared to the $74M Shazam 1 profited back in 2019. I estimate that Blue Beetle lost **$75.3M** for WB. I estimate that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom lost **$52.4M** for WB compared to the $260.5M Aquaman 1 profited back in 2018. Add in The Flash (-155M) and DC lost **$379.8M** last year alone for WB. How does this compare to the last two standalone DC films? The Batman had a profit of $177M while Joker had a profit of $437M (half of which went to WB).

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

Last week, the Summer Box Office did not kick off to a very hot start as the two new openers performed vastly under the typical MCU outing in this slot.  Still, not all bad news as the big opener, **The Fall Guy,** out-grossed my rather underwhelming **$1.66M Thurs** and **$6.07M Fri** estimates.  Not stellar, but at least the actuals came in above my **$8.48M Wed+Thurs+Fri** predictions.  The positive news cannot be said for **Tarot** as actuals came in under my already **$.84M Thurs and $2.69M Fri** expectations.  Even though the PG-13 horror cash grab could not catch up to my **$3.53M Thurs+Fri** predicted opening, it seems to be set up fine against its paltry **$8M** budget.  For The Fall Guy, it now looks to struggle against an arguably too high **$130M** price=tag.  Should the action rom-com have been that high to start with?  No.  Is this opening truly a disappointment?  Not when you look at the other titles of a similar genre that have opened right in this lane.  With great buzz, Mother's Day, and no immediate competition, there is still time for the Ryan Gosling/Emily Blunt pic to save face.

Next up in the Summer movie line up is the perfect film for Mother's Day weekend, **Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.**  After 7 years, the once dormant 50-year franchise is back following the commercial and critical acclaim of the 2010s reboot trilogy.  While continuing the timeline of the recent series, this latest outing is setup to not only bring in the franchise's usual fans, but attract a whole new audience.  Yet, after a steeper than desired drop-off from the trilogy concluder, **War for the Planet of the Apes,** all eyes are on this reboot/sequel to see if it can be the kick-off to a new series of monkey outings, even without a cast of notable names.  As a adult-driven PG-13 blockbuster, we will use **Transformers: Rise of the Beasts** as a comp.  I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

https://preview.redd.it/ny1hr83d9izc1.png?width=2346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05e980f9fd4e0031d7f8b3678d66f4d45a6f5f57

For Thursday, KotPotA is showing that it means no monkey business.  Not only were ticket sales healthy to start with, but its exponential growth throughout the week shows extremely encouraging signs of audience awareness.  Currently, KotPotA  is on track for a **$4.46M Thurs** compared to T:RotB.  (**Things to Note:** There were Early Access screenings on Wednesday that will be counted in later.)  We're back, baby!  After an underwhelming opening last weekend, this outing feels more in line to Summer and is strong for an entry this early in the season.  As an franchise, action flick, the theater capacities are pretty run of the mill with **M: 5.03% and EH: 5.83%.**  Certainly healthy and signifying demand from audiences, even if it lacks behind T:RotB's **M: 7.07% and EH: 10.16%** capacities.  As a 2.5 hour franchise outing, there is no extreme demand for audiences to flock for previews, so a start this well is certainly encouraging for these apes to break out.

https://preview.redd.it/aog1tcp0qizc1.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50aa0ebe03760fdf190c9aa368d2394693fb92a6

Audiences, together, strong as Friday continues to be just as strong as Thursday.  Once again, tickets were already off to a good start for the week, but they've show signs of a growing momentum throughout the week.  At this rate, KotPotA is looking at a **$13.45M** compared to T:RotB.  Not bad for a revitalization of near decade wait of a sequel.  Even with a plethora of showtimes, the theater capacities are keeping up with **M: 3.73% and EH: 10.26%.**  With Theater 2 being the more ""in-demand"" theater, the apes are looking to be in good company among the adult crowd.  Like Thursday, the demands are right behind T:RotB's capacities of **M: 6.58% and EH: 10.26%.**  The walk-up friendly Theater 1 may not have as much of a drive, but with the current pace of sales, there is a strong possibility for growth in the final hours.  While it may not match up to the opening heights of the 2010s trilogy, KotPotA is off to an encouraging start.

Overall, this will bring Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to an Pre+Thur+Fri opening of **$18.91M**.  Definitely feels like the Summer is back on track after last weekend. If these numbers hold, we could be looking at a 3-day weekend of **$50M.**  Since Mother's Day is on Sunday, this number could have a stronger than usual shift up or down as this franchise is not known to draw in older women.  Still, thanks to a reasonable **$160M** budget, these apes may not be  going bananas, but they certainly are holding their own for a franchise that could have happily been left in the closet.

I have taken some suggestions to help make this post better. Please comment if you have anymore!

That got me thinking...do you think we'd see some new franchises created out of nowhere based on original IPs  (or existing ones that weren't a big success before?)

Will we see new Barbie Cinematic Universe? There's a new Bad Boys movie coming out this year, new Apes moive, there was a new Godzilla movie...

What about other stuff? Will we see potential reboots of...idk, let's say the ""Silent Place"" universe 30 years from now the way we see with Star Wars/LOTR?

It’s going to follow to very popular characters, characters that starred in arguably the most popular D+ show ever. 

On the negative side, Star Wars has had much more content recently, with a lot of them having mixed reception. This includes Mando S3, which to many was easily the worst season of the 3. Not to mention, this is a sequel to a TV show.

LOTR has the benefit of being away from the big screen for a lot longer. New LOTR content is a lot less consistent than new Star Wars content. Plus, a probable December release date can do wonders for its legs, compared to Mando’s summer releases date.

In the negative side, Gollum may be a weird character to focus on. And as a prequel, success may be limited. In addition to that, while there has been great success for LOTR, The Hobbit, and even Rings of Power, the previous two had been somewhat divisive (although not nearly as much as some of the Star Wars content).

###**Spy X Family:**

Spy X Family adds another $0.37M on Thursday. Will get affected by the work Saturday just like everything else. 

Currently projected a $1.75M weekend. 

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban:  7.5

In its opening weekend Spy X Family swayed towards women with a 54-46 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings albeit with a tiny 0.1 poi nt different. 

The movie is predominantly leaning towards people in the 20-30 age bracket. These people have also naturaly been most favorable to the movie in reviews.

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle is stabilizing a bit better.

Projected a $1.25M weekend.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6    , Douban:  9.1

In its opening weekend Howl's Moving Castle swayed dominantly towards women with a 65-35 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings by a slightly bigger 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Just as Spy X Family, Howl's Moving Castle was doominated by the 20-30 age brackets albeit it did generaly sway a bit more towards older people above 30. Ratings wise there seems to be a concensus across the board with every age group giving it high ratings.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit meanwhile has a bad day. Drops below $1M for the first time as it crosses $60M total.

Heads for only a $3.5M weekend.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.0  , Taopiaopiao: 9.4     , Douban: 5.6

In its opening weekend Formed Police Unit unsurprisingly swayed even more dominantly towards women than the animated movies with a huge 72-28 gender split in their favor. Wang Yibo bringing in its hardcore fanbase. Naturaly women have therefore also been way way way more favorable to the movie to a hilarious degree. I'm talking a 1.2-1.7 points sway in ratings between genders. 

The age group split for this one is way more balance with everything from 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40+ getting a 15-20% share. Only the below 20 bracket lagged behind with 6%. Ratings wise the really young teen groups and the older groups at 35+ rated the movie the highest with the in between viewing the movie less favorably.

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy continues to hold better how more than doubling the gross of Formed Police Unit after opening $5M lower on its opening day last week. 

Heading for a potential $7.2M weekend that could take it north of $70M

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.1     , Douban: 6.1

In its opening weekend The Last Frenzy swayed quite balanced but still in favor of women witn a 52-48 gender split in their favor. They have also been slightly more favorable to the movie in ratings by a 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Age brackets wise its somewhat dominated by the 20-30 brackets but also has a significant portion of older brackets pulling 15%. It is however almost non existent with under 20's which make up just a 2-3% margin. Ratings wise its rated quite evenly across all brackets.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre.

There is no reason Dial of Destiny needed to cost that much, and even with a $200M budget it still would have flopped but not as terribly. 

Inflation is part of the reason why movies got so much more expensive, but even if you adjust to 2024 dollars those would still be less than the blockbusters of today. Is it because of VFX? Cast and crew salaries? Something else entirely?",13,0

But I thought it was worth sharing the gender, age and ethnic demographics mentioned in Mendelson's excellent **Outside Scoop** podcast discussion of *Fall Guy's* mysterious under-performance   
  
Link in comments (Reddit screws up the image, otherwise) 

The idea is that because the marketing didn't succeed in turning out a specific demo on the opening weekend - as something like *The Woman King* did - the film's wide, general audience will gradually show up as and when they feel like it, over coming days and weeks

Mendelson and his co-hosts mention that the film skewed white, although the ethnic split is similar to that of the US as a whole, over-performing for Latin and Asian audiences, if anything

Certain NC-17 films like 'Shame' or 'Blue Is The Warmest Color' managed to perform decently ($3.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively), but rarely cracked more than 100 screens due to big theater chains not wanting to play films with that rating.

Nowadays, big theater chains like Regal/AMC/Cinemark have no hesitancy playing ""Unrated"" films. ‘Terrifier 2’, for instance, was given an Unrated certification, yet it had a wide release with 1.5k theaters. That film would have objectively been given an NC-17 by the MPAA had the creators submitted it, but they instead released it as Unrated as a way to bypass the “no NC-17” policy of some big theater chains. This just begs the question if the industry is going to do away with the NC-17 rating all together now that big theater chains no longer take issue with showing films that are Unrated (and would've otherwise been given an NC-17 by the MPAA).",41,87

""*While five films may seem like a wealth of riches, especially for theaters desperately craving content, too many films on a single weekend can lead to less than the sum of its parts. Consider the weekend of April 14, 2023. That was the last time a weekend had five wide releases. None of the five made over $10M, with THE POPE’S EXORCIST being the top debut with $9M. An argument could be made that these films would all be better served on a less crowded weekend.""*

*""There’s another reason August 9th is noteworthy. Three of the five – BORDERLANDS, CUCKOO, TRAP – have trailers and posters in the marketplace. The other two, THE FIRE INSIDE and IT ENDS WITH US, do not. These two are the films closest to release without a trailer. And while it’s by no means a kiss of death to have a late campaign, it is of concern when a film is less than 100 days away without a trailer.* 

*Why does it matter? It matters because awareness (and interest) builds as people walk past posters in their local theater’s halls and see the trailer before the film starts. The lack of marketing material often runs in parallel with low awareness. Only 11% of people know about FIRE, while only 16% are aware of ENDS despite the film being based on a best-selling book. ""*",2,7

###**Spy X Family:**

Spy X Family just like most of the market contonues to feel the post holiday lul. Might not even reach $45M at this point but it should still try and become the movies best market beating Japans($41M)

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban:  7.5

In its opening weekend Spy X Family swayed towards women with a 54-46 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings albeit with a tiny 0.1 poi nt different. 

The movie is predominantly leaning towards people in the 20-30 age bracket. These people have also naturaly been most favorable to the movie in reviews.

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle fares just a tiny bit better.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6    , Douban:  9.1

In its opening weekend Howl's Moving Castle swayed dominantly towards women with a 65-35 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings by a slightly bigger 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Just as Spy X Family, Howl's Moving Castle was doominated by the 20-30 age brackets albeit it did generaly sway a bit more towards older people above 30. Ratings wise there seems to be a concensus across the board with every age group giving it high ratings.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit now mostly stabilized but its projections keep decreasing and the movie could now end below $80M

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.0  , Taopiaopiao: 9.4     , Douban: 5.6

In its opening weekend Formed Police Unit unsurprisingly swayed even more dominantly towards women than the animated movies with a huge 72-28 gender split in their favor. Wang Yibo bringing in its hardcore fanbase. Naturaly women have therefore also been way way way more favorable to the movie to a hilarious degree. I'm talking a 1.2-1.7 points sway in ratings between genders. 

The age group split for this one is way more balance with everything from 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40+ getting a 15-20% share. Only the below 20 bracket lagged behind with 6%. Ratings wise the really young teen groups and the older groups at 35+ rated the movie the highest with the in between viewing the movie less favorably.

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy crosses $60M today and manages to cling onto Twilight Of The Warriors for now. Their total projections are pretty much identical at this point.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.1     , Douban: 6.1

In its opening weekend The Last Frenzy swayed quite balanced but still in favor of women witn a 52-48 gender split in their favor. They have also been slightly more favorable to the movie in ratings by a 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Age brackets wise its somewhat dominated by the 20-30 brackets but also has a significant portion of older brackets pulling 15%. It is however almost non existent with under 20's which make up just a 2-3% margin. Ratings wise its rated quite evenly across all brackets.

###**Twilight of The Warriors**

Twilight of The Warriors remains in the lead and is the best holding Holiday movie being the only sub -70% week on week drop in the top 8. It has now passed $50M. The 3rd Labour Day lineup to do so.

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. You're not forced to make predictions for all films. These predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the two films for the week.

#**Bad Boys: Ride or Die**

The film is directed by Adil &amp; Bilall (*Bad Boys For Life* and *Ms. Marvel*) and written by Chris Bremner. It's the fourth installment in the *Bad Boys* franchise, and it stars Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Paola Núñez, Eric Dane, Ioan Gruffudd, Jacob Scipio, Melanie Liburd, Tasha Smith, Tiffany Haddish and Joe Pantoliano. It follows Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigating corruption within the Miami PD when their late Captain Conrad Howard is posthumously accused of being involved with drug cartels, but a setup turns them into fugitives, forcing them to work outside the law in order to solve the case.

#**The Watchers**

The film is written and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan (*Servant*), based on the novel of the same name by A. M. Shine. It stars Dakota Fanning, Georgina Campbell, Oliver Finnegan, and Olwen Fouéré, and follows trapped people at a shelter in the forest, who are watched and stalked by mysterious creatures each night.

Now that you've met this week's new releases. Let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- *Bad Boys* is one of Sony's most lucrative franchises. Since it started in 1995, each film has rose at the box office, with *Bad Boys For Life* earning over $426 million worldwide. A huge advantage is that, while the previous films took 8 and 13 years respectively to get sequels, this arrives just 4 years later. The trailers also promise to offer exactly what the fans of the franchise love: pure action comedy.

- With horror seeing weak returns so far, perhaps *The Watcher* could get some interest from those looking for something new. The trailers look intriguing, so perhaps it could find an audience.

#**CONS**

- Well, there's the elephant in the room; this is going to be Will Smith's first theatrical release following the slap at the Oscars. It's been two years, but the event is still drawing negative attention to Smith. Big enough to impact the film? 

- As previously said, horror has been seeing a weak run in 2024 so far. The highest grossing film is still *Night Swim* with just $54 million, while other titles failed to find an audience. The trailers are amping up M. Night Shyamalan's presence, but that has its own setbacks: he is not the director, and his name has been losing interest with his past films. It's also going to face the anticipated *A Quiet Place: Day One* in just 3 weeks.

And here's the past results.

Movie | Release Date | Distributor | Domestic Debut | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total

**Critics Consensus:** Carving out a new era for *The Planet of the Apes* with lovable characters and rich visuals, *Kingdom* doesn't take the crown as best of the franchise but handily justifies its continued reign.

**Sample Reviews:**

It doesn’t have a cast of big-name stars. Yet though the movie is too long, I was more gratified than not to sink into its relatively old-fashioned dramatic restraint. - Owen Gleiberman, Variety

Fans of the franchise should find much to enjoy in this very solid new installment, which points the way forward to a potential new recalibration of the human-ape balance. - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter

The effects are just jaw-dropping, from the ability to see individual hairs on the back of a monkey to the way leaves fall and the crack of tree limbs echoing in the forest. **3.5/4** \- Mark Kennedy, Associated Press

“Kingdom” checks most of the boxes for longtime “Apes” fans, and newbies don’t need to any prior homework as a standalone story that mostly explains itself. **3/4** \- Brian Truitt, USA Today

What makes “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” powerful, in the end... \[is that\] it probes how the act of co-opting idealisms and converting them to dogmas has occurred many times over. - Alissa Wilkinson, New York Times

As much as “Kingdom” borrows from the 1968 film, Ball has also clearly been influenced by what’s come since in the genre. **3.5/4** \- Johnny Oleksinski, New York Post

Until this franchise stops mistaking its stone-cold misanthropy for political virtue, this franchise is going nowhere. **1/4** \- Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle

The fights are boring. More brains and less brawn probably aren't a prescription for box-office success for a movie like this. But it's a movie I'd rather see. **3/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

It takes just a couple minutes to be immersed completely in the world of the movie. **3.5/4** Chris Hewitt, Minneapolis Star Tribune

Ball takes his time introducing his characters, which pays off by making us care about their struggles. **3/4** \- Peter Howell, Toronto Star

Gawking can only take audiences so far – and the journey that Ball and screenwriter Josh Friedman lay out is a long, treacherous, and exhausting one. - Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail

This franchise has held up an awful lot better than others; now it should evolve to something new. **3/5** \- Peter Bradshaw, Guardian

The final act is a mess and juggles four or five plot lines before settling on a dire jump-the-shark moment featuring Noa and a troop of warbling monkeys. **2/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

Sincerity and conviction are now rare qualities in the blockbuster field, but this is a film that puts its monkey where its mouth is. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

Behind the impressive CGI, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the definition of generic, all two hours and 25 minutes of it. **2/5** \- Caryn James, BBC.com

Directed by Wes Ball, ""Kingdom"" doesn’t reach the rattling grandeur of ""Dawn"". But it's another worthy installment in a series that is pretty much unparalleled in contemporary times. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

You’re essentially left with nothing but Blockbuster 101 grandstanding. Welcome to the emptiest of monkeyhouses. - David Fear, Rolling StoneIt's less action-heavy than the last trilogy and inevitably more ape-centric, but this is a promisingly chewy start for the latest series of simian thrillers. These apes are still strong. **3/5** \- Helen O'Hara, Empire Magazine

Considering how effortlessly Ball returns us to this riveting, sweeping universe, those next instalments can be eagerly anticipated. - Tim Grierson, Screen International

“Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” is such a rewardingly cerebral journey because of its refusal to dictator-shame its villain or offer a clear alternative for the apes forced to serve at his mercy. **B** \- David Ehrlich, indieWire

By the time the demands of big-budget spectacle take over, a film that initially stands out from the pack in imagining a different perspective of the world ends up looking like everything else in the current mega-budget cinema landscape. **2/4** \- Jake Cole, Slant Magazine

An intermittently entertaining but ultimately fruitless exercise in franchise expansion. - Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict

A good sequel that feels like it could have been a great one. **6/10** \- Matt Singer, ScreenCrush

With captivating performances, astounding VFX and richly developed characters, this latest chapter feels fresh and immensely satisfying, delivering on both story and spectacle. A true delight. **5/5** \- Linda Marric, HeyUGuys

**SYNOPSIS:**

Director Wes Ball breathes new life into the global, epic franchise set several generations in the future following Caesar’s reign, in which apes are the dominant species living harmoniously and humans have been reduced to living in the shadows. As a new tyrannical ape leader builds his empire, one young ape undertakes a harrowing journey that will cause him to question all that he has known about the past and to make choices that will define a future for apes and humans alike.

What's yours?","Last year Universal pronounced the results of their internal studies showing the early PVOD of a certain a film doesn't impact that film's box office if you time it when the box office reaches a certain low ""drop"". 

**My thesis is simple:** early PVOD doesn't affect the respective film's box office since it's timed so as not to, but it does affect all future box office long-term. **My proof of this is anecdotal;** waiting for early PVOD is now an option I always consider for a film. I and my friends find ourselves today more than ever arguing ""we can just wait for PVOD, they drop early these days"". We did it with Godzilla minus one, and Challengers. It also discouraged several of us from a viewing Dune part 2 in theaters as its PVOD dropped only 6 weeks after theatrical. 

Do you share my experience? is early PVOD harming the box office long term? the common wisdom today is that it doesn't. I believe it doesn't for the respective film since they time it when its box office reaches a certain low but it is habit-forming to negatively impact the box office of future films. ",69,74

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Mobile Suit Gundam SEED FREEDOM**

- Flip (Selling good compared to Spy X Family, but it has much less showings and no PLFs (May 2).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.93M**

- abracadabra1998 ($1.15M EA comp and $3.09M Thursday comp.  The average went down artificially because I didn't track GxK's last week and missed today's update for Madame Web, all comps actually went up except for Indy which stayed steady! (May 6). Very good EA numbers at the moment, and I would think that with it drawing from Thursday previews that is also a good sign. I am bullish for this, pace keeps doing pretty well! (May 5). Keeps doing really well and rising against comps (May 2). This has been doing pretty consistently well (April 25).)

- AniNate (These presales leave something to be desired (May 4).)

- crazymoviekid ($3.98M Thursday comp.)

- el sid (Over $4M Thursday for sure from my theaters (May 7).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.05M EA comp and $4.21M Thursday comp.  $1.72M EA Santikos comp and $2.52M Thursday Santikos comp. Nothing amazing at Santikos yet.  Usually this chain goes crazy with this type of movie so we'll see if it blows up in the last few days. | Sticking pretty close to GxK pace so I'd lean into that comp a bit as the others will likely shift more (May 7). Added Godzilla which brought the average way up (May 1).)

- keysersoze123 (Its going to open bigger than Fall Guy for sure. Not sure how wide the early shows are. But a EA gross around 1.5m could be in play. Previews we have to wait and see how it accelerates close to release (April 27). Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing close to a $90M opening weekend (April 9).)

- Porthos ($7.01M EA+Thursday comp. Could be that EA is very strong locally and that's putting a bit more of a thumb on the scale.  I expect these comps to go down, and quite a bit, but could just be that this is popular in Sacramento for whatever reason (May 6).)

- Rorschach ($10.7M Thursday comp and $22.2M Friday comp.)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.43M Thursday comp.  Overall, a good update...Looking like $4M+ previews without EA (May 6). Not the best growth, but not terrible either. Increased against all comps which is a good sign (May 5). Starting to accelerate. Very good growth (May 3). Not even going to update Planet of the Apes because its growth has been pitiful (April 30).)

- Vafrow ($3.9M EA+Thursday comp.  Decent day (May 9). A slight decline in the comps, as the preceding Sunday is usually a big day for sales. Still, it's holding it's own (May 8). A good jump up in the comps (May 7). Growth remains steady, letting it hold ground (May 4). Staying pretty steady (May 3). It is trending in the right direction right now (May 1). It actually had a decent day (April 29). Sales dropped by 3. Cancelled tickets for one of the shows it seems. It keeps getting worse (April 28). Continues to be sluggish (April 26).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**IF Thursday comp: $1.91M**

- PROMOTIONS (APRIL 29 ONLY: Each purchased ticket with RegalMovies gifts a ticket to someone at 826. Regal offering 2500 rewards points.)

- abracadabra1998 ($0.91M Thursday comp. Rising against comps as expected, due to the short release window, but I am still failing to see anything that suggests the numbers given by some other outlets (May 5). The release window for this is way shorter than all these comps so those numbers will naturally go up. Decent growth in the last three days (May 2). Comps are obviously silly at this stage, just wanted to show that unsurprisingly not really a lot of interest from a get-go. We shall see how it does in these coming weeks (April 29).)

- AniNate(I did see a surprising amount of single sales looking at IF charts (May 1). Gonna try some amateur local tracking: 55 tickets sold across 4 Cinemarks.  I feel like this level of unadulterated upfront interest is pretty notable for an original family movie (April 30).)

- charlie Jatinder (Hmm. So no real Regal impact it seems at katnisscinnaplex's theaters (April 30).)

- DAJK (Selling pretty well so far here (May 4).)

- el sid (Not really signs for a breakout for Friday so far, but very solid. It will not really get 4-6M Thursday e.g. compared to Migration but from most comps the number could be pretty decent (May 7). Looked good for the film, both on Thursday and on Friday (May 6).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.87M Thursday comp and $1.45M EA+Thursday comp. 25 Regal sales (out of 45?) (April 30).)

-  TheFlatLannister ($2.54M Thursday comp.  After a strong start, this has cooled off quite a bit (May 4). This is very good considering the lower amount of showings it has (April 30).)

- vafrow ($2.3M Thursday comp.  Numbers are still really low, making the standard track fairly useless. I did do a larger 100km radius track, encompassing the broader southern Ontaro market (~8M population, MTC4 being about 70-80% of the market). Even against Haunted Mansion, which underindexed here, it's not doing well (May 4). For a 100 km radius (which captures the whole broader region, probably about an 8M population base), it's sold 11 tickets. Still no sales locally (April 30). I think this only went up overnight, so it's not too odd to have zero sales (April 29).)

**The Strangers: Chapter 1 Thursday Comp: $1.69M**

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.69M Thursday comp)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.25M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.78M EA comp and $1.12M Thursday comp.  Seems like it'll be like Trolls where EA syphons off all the early sales. Very low sales will lead to big variance in these early days. Trolls ($1.63M) is the most useful Thursday comp due to similar EA situations (April 25).)

- el sid (The very even sales are a good sign (May 7). For Sunday, May 19, I can already report that also in my theaters it looks very good for Garfield. They will for sure add shows soon. It has so far only 1 show/theater and the shows are almost sold out, between 1 and 4 seats are still available. So my guess still is that this movie if it's not totally bad (and first reviews here were quite positive) will become a (big) hit. Seems not much on Thursday but it's a step in the right direction (May 6). The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.59M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales for my core sample for previews. But I did the larger sweep, which shows the interest right now is the Sunday early access shows. Looking at sales patterns, it's mainly blocks of 3/4 tickets, so likely families grabbing some. It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4). Still no sales (April 28). Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- katnisscinnaplex (Up to ~1,400 shows now with new locations picking it up and others adding a second showing.  LotR1 has sold 831 seats OD, LotR2 sold 715 seats OD, and LotR3 sold 735 seats OD.  For comparison, Phantom Menace didn't break 800 tickets until T-3 and we're still over a month out.  JW3 comp is currently around 9m (it was at 1,670 tickets sold at this point!) (May 6). Just for kicks I took a look at the LotR re-releases scheduled for June.  They're getting one show each (for the most part) in around 1k theaters. Some locations already adding a second showing (April 30). Looks to be in around 1k theaters.   Sales looking good already as expected (I already got mine!) (April 26).)

- (Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes: First official projections put the opening day at aroun $2.5-$2.7M. Poor but expected given the work Saturday. Weekend should be SUN&gt;SAT&gt;FRI if it follows GOTG3 which openend on a similiarly affected weekend last year (May 7). Unfortunately for the Apes Saturday is a work day to compensate for the current Holidays so the Weekend will be deflated quite a lot which explains the weaker than expected pre-sales. It continues trundling along at a slow pace in light of that (May 4). Pre-sales are now live.  3rd party projections seem to think it can do at least $30M+ with some leaning closer to $40M+. Its not been the hotest start of the pre-sales thats for sure however a lot of the attention currently is drawn elsewhere with the Holidays start and there's still over a week to go for things to pick up (May 1).)

I think the new TV series, remake of harry potter, is a bit of a risk. Obviously the interest will be super high, but probably the budget will be high too if they're going to adapt every book and putting even more details than what we had with the movies ( I understand the movies are not loved by everyone but I think they're an amazing example of movie adaptation as well as Dune). 

So I know it would sound a bit avid and capitalist but I think fantasy or soft fantasy is a very underrepresented genre at cinema while instead for example we're having a lot of cinecomic even nowadays where it seems there's a bit of  loosing interest in that world. 

The only reason in my opinion that stops Warner to start another movie in wizarding world is the control of jk Rowling. So I think probably she has not liked the ideas Warner has churned out or she would like to write the story herself (like with fantastic beasts) and warner didn't like the idea or it's scared they could receive backlash if the story is written by her. 

But as a movie theatre fan and an harry potter fan I must say that the idea of having ""just"" a new harry potter series for the next 5/10 years is pretty disappointing. It's a world that requires movie theatre, IMAX, Dolby cinema ... Not a 43"" TV . It's the same thinking I would have with star wars. I know fantastic beasts, especially the last one, underperformed with ""only"" 400m worldwide but is a massive budgeted harry potter tv series remake the only good idea WB has with this important franchise? And wizarding world is probably the 2nd ""product"" they have in terms of importance and general popularity after DC comics , or even more popular than that one in some areas like Europe or Japan.

**Pre-Sales map for tomorrow**

The Last Frenzy continues to lead pre-sales in the north but elsewhere its more a mishmash for tomorrow.

###**Spy X Family:**

Spy X Family enters its 2nd week expectedly droping like a rock versus its Holidays boosted opening day. 

It just like the whole market has come in under projections today which has firmly put $50M out of question.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban:  7.5

In its opening weekend Spy X Family swayed towards women with a 54-46 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings albeit with a tiny 0.1 poi nt different. 

The movie is predominantly leaning towards people in the 20-30 age bracket. These people have also naturaly been most favorable to the movie in reviews.

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle also drops but slightly less so.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6    , Douban:  9.1

In its opening weekend Howl's Moving Castle swayed dominantly towards women with a 65-35 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings by a slightly bigger 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Just as Spy X Family, Howl's Moving Castle was doominated by the 20-30 age brackets albeit it did generaly sway a bit more towards older people above 30. Ratings wise there seems to be a concensus across the board with every age group giving it high ratings.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit somewhat stabilizies today but its now already trailing well behind the top 2 and has today been overtaken in total gross by The Last Frenzy.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.0  , Taopiaopiao: 9.4     , Douban: 5.6

In its opening weekend Formed Police Unit unsurprisingly swayed even more dominantly towards women than the animated movies with a huge 72-28 gender split in their favor. Wang Yibo bringing in its hardcore fanbase. Naturaly women have therefore also been way way way more favorable to the movie to a hilarious degree. I'm talking a 1.2-1.7 points sway in ratings between genders. 

The age group split for this one is way more balance with everything from 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40+ getting a 15-20% share. Only the below 20 bracket lagged behind with 6%. Ratings wise the really young teen groups and the older groups at 35+ rated the movie the highest with the in between viewing the movie less favorably.

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy as said is now the top grossing Labour Day release. It remained in 2nd today and tomorrow it will hit $60M

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.1     , Douban: 6.1

In its opening weekend The Last Frenzy swayed quite balanced but still in favor of women witn a 52-48 gender split in their favor. They have also been slightly more favorable to the movie in ratings by a 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Age brackets wise its somewhat dominated by the 20-30 brackets but also has a significant portion of older brackets pulling 15%. It is however almost non existent with under 20's which make up just a 2-3% margin. Ratings wise its rated quite evenly across all brackets.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

- Added a few movies releasing in the next month and a half.

- The IP was meaningless in terms of box office, just a security blanket for execs and studio financiers 

- A mistake to launch it in the SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER SEASON HAS STARTED May window

- Should have been either a rom-com or an action movie, rather than a hybrid 

- The budget was too big

- Either make it with those stars and less spent on stunts/VFX or an action/VFX movie with cheaper stars

- Neither Gosling nor Blunt have a history of opening movies 

- Gosling's *Barbie* success and Oscars moment didn't translate into an ability to secure a big opening weekend 

- The movie will probably make around the same as *Bullet Train*

I was waiting for Deadline to finish their 2023 Most Valuable Blockbuster List. Deadline actually did do an initial estimated profit breakdown early in No Way Home's box office run but unfortunately did not update it once No Way Home completed its run. I used Deadline's initial profit breakdown for No Way Home and  other MCU movies as comps. I estimate that No Way Home had a profit of **$744.8M** making it not only the second most profitable MCU movie ever but the third most profitable movie since 2013 when Deadline started their Most Valuable Blockbuster Tournament after Endgame ($890M) and The Force Awakens ($780.1M).

It's the first weekend of May, which means that the summer season is officially starting.

&amp;#x200B;

And it started in a huge whimper, as ***The Fall Guy*** failed to build interest among moviegoers. Disney's re-release of ***Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*** performed solidly, while ***Tarot*** had one of the worst debuts in 3,000 theaters.

&amp;#x200B;

The Top 10 earned a combined $68.3 million this weekend. This represents a massive 56.2% drop from last year, when ***Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*** opened with $118 million. Excluding 2021 and 2020 for the pandemic, this was the worst first weekend of May since 1998. That's a horrible way to kick off the summer season, and it guarantees that this will be one of the worst summers in recent memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Debuting in 4,002 theaters, Universal's ***The Fall Guy*** disappointed with just $27.7 million this weekend. That's less than what David Leitch's previous film, ***Bullet Train***, made back in August 2022 ($30 million). That makes the numbers so disappointing, especially as ***The Fall Guy*** was the first high budget blockbuster in one month.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, this debut is even worse than you can imagine for the summer kick-off. The first weekend of May marks the beginning of the summer season, and studios often put the most anticipated title here (mostly Marvel). This was the worst debut in this weekend since ***Kingdom of Heaven*** flopped back in 2005 with just $19 million. But it doesn't stop just there; adjusted for inflation, it was the worst debut since ***He Got Game*** back in 1998 ($7.6 million unadjusted, $14.5 million adjusted). So it opened lower than other titles like ***The Mummy*** films ($43.3 million and $68.1 million), ***Gladiator*** ($34.8 million), ***Van Helsing*** ($51.7 million), and ***Mission: Impossible III*** ($47.7 million).

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we want to downplay that it's not fair to compare it to the previous films, that doesn't change the fact that it's a very poor start. Even Universal was confident that it seemed appropriate for this to open the summer season, they gave it a $130 million budget after all.

&amp;#x200B;

Films about Hollywood are always a tough sell, just look at how badly ***Babylon*** did back in 2022. ***Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*** is an exception, and that's because Quentin Tarantino, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are far bigger names than anyone in ***The Fall Guy***. So Universal wanted to highlight action and comedy in the trailers, emphasizing the roles of stuntmen in the film. It's not uncommon to adapt TV shows as films, but it's likely a lot of people are unaware that the film is based on an 1980s TV show (to the point that the TV lead Lee Majors appears in a cameo). A familiarity with the show could help in building nostalgia, but the original ***Fall Guy*** is not as fondly remembered as other classic shows like ***Charlie's Angels*** or ***Miami Vice***.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, we addressed the topic of star power with Zendaya and ***Challengers***, and it feels like we gotta re-adress it here. Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt are known stars and have been part of some successful films. Yet it looks like they have been struggling in opening films based on their names alone. Gosling has starred in many flops in the past years, which included ***The Nice Guys***, ***Blade Runner 2049*** and ***First Man***, with ***La La Land*** and ***Barbie*** marking exceptions. Blunt hasn't had many flops, and she can be credited for the box office success of ***A Quiet Place***, ***The Girl on the Train*** and ***Sicario***. It simply wasn't enough. If you're curious on how much impact their presence had: Deadline said that 50% came for Ryan Gosling, while 35% came for Emily Blunt. And that makes you wonder, if this is what they can bring, then imagine how low it would be with lesser known stars.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Universal, 54% of the audience was male. It failed to attract interest among young audiences; a massive 71% was 25 and over. In some good news, the film has very good reviews and the audience also appears to like it: they gave it a solid ""A–"" on CinemaScore. The hope is that it can leg out like ***Bullet Train***, but that will be tough considering that film had a very weak August, while ***The Fall Guy*** will face a blockbuster each week. If the film fails to hit $100 million, that would be very bad news for the summer season.

&amp;#x200B;

Second place belonged to another newcomer, Disney's re-release of ***Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*** for its 25th anniversary. Debuting in 2,700 theaters, it earned $8 million this weekend. That's far off from its numbers back in 2012 when it re-released with $22 million, but this is still a very solid debut considering re-releases don't make this much in the past years. For comparison, the re-release of ***Return of the Jedi*** last year debuted with $5.1 million. With this, its lifetime gross is now $482.6 million in North America. This is only for a limited time, and it also includes a preview for ***The Acolyte***.

&amp;#x200B;

In third place, MGM's ***Challengers*** added $7.6 million this weekend. That represents a 49% drop, which is fine, but not fantastic considering its low debut. Through ten days, the film has earned $29.4 million.

&amp;#x200B;

In fourth place, Sony's horror film ***Tarot*** earned just $6.5 million in 3,104 theaters. That's one of the worst debuts for a film playing at 3,000+ theaters. Even with a low $8 million budget, this is not anything to write home about. With horrible reviews and poor word of mouth (""C–"" on CinemaScore), expect this to fade away quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** is still trying to hit the $200 million milestone. This weekend, it dipped 37% and added $4.5 million. That takes its domestic total to $188.1 million.

&amp;#x200B;

A24's ***Civil War*** wound up in fifth place, easing just 48% and adding $3.5 million. The film has already made $62 million, and it looks like it might hit $70 million.

&amp;#x200B;

In seventh place, Lionsgate's ***Unsung Hero*** added $2.9 million. That represents an awful 61% drop, which is quite steep considering its ""A+"" on CinemaScore. With $13.1 million in the bank, it will now finish below $20 million.

&amp;#x200B;

***Kung Fu Panda 4*** continued holding well, dropping just 30% and adding $2.5 million. Its domestic total is now $188.4 million, and it has one last week before ***IF*** takes its family demo.

&amp;#x200B;

In ninth place, Universal's ***Abigail*** is on its last legs and it was just its third weekend. The film collapsed 55% and made $2.3 million this weekend. Its domestic total stands at $22.8 million and now will finish below $30 million, and it might finish below Radio Silence's ***Ready or Not*** ($28.7 million).

&amp;#x200B;

Rounding up the Top 10 was ***Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire***. It added $1.8 million after dropping 43%, which takes its domestic total to $109.9 million.

&amp;#x200B;

A24 released ***I Saw the TV Glow*** in 4 theaters, debuting with $116,340. That translates to a fine but not great $29,085 per-theater average. It will continue expanding in the coming weeks.

#**OVERSEAS**

***The Fall Guy*** also led the overseas numbers, yet it wasn't anything memorable either. It expanded to 78 markets, and added $25.4 million. Adding last week's previews and its domestic performance, its worldwide total stands at $64.4 million. That's quite underwhelming, considering its $130 million budget. It had soft-to-mediocre debuts in the UK ($4.4M), Mexico ($2.5M), France ($2.3M), Germany ($1.9M), Italy ($1.4M), and South Korea ($1.1M). With competition on its way with ***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*** this week, the film will probably fail to break even, which is a very way to start the summer season.

&amp;#x200B;

3 weeks ahead of its debut in North America, ***The Garfield Movie*** debuted with $22 million in 18 markets. It had a strong debut in Mexico, earning $8.4 million in its first six days, followed by Spain with $3.2 million over five days, Brazil at $2.2 million, Italy with $1.6 million and Peru at $1.3 million. We'll see how it goes as it continues expanding.

&amp;#x200B;

***Godzilla x Kong*** added another $9.8 million, taking its worldwide total to $547 million. Its best markets are China ($131.3M), Mexico ($33.2M), UK ($17.5M), India ($15.2M) and Australia ($12M).

&amp;#x200B;

***Kung Fu Panda 4*** added another $7.7 million for a $520 million worldwide total.

&amp;#x200B;

After its disappointing start, ***Challengers*** appears to have some minimal power overseas. It eased just 24% and added $7.5 million, taking its worldwide total to $50 million. Its best new market was Netherlands, but it opened to just $485K. Its best markets are the UK ($4.4M), Italy ($3.3M), France ($2.3M), Australia ($2M) and Mexico ($1.6M). It's still got a long way to go before breaking even.

&amp;#x200B;

***Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*** also re-released in a few markets, adding $6.4 million. With these numbers, its worldwide total now stands at $1.035 billion.

#**MOVIES THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Immaculate* | Mar/22 | Neon | $5,338,921 | $15,671,306 | $19,790,679 | $9M

- Neon's ***Immaculate*** has closed with $19 million worldwide. Domestically, it's Neon's fourth highest grossing film, but it's not a high bar. It was lucky to get weak competition on the way, but these numbers are quite low for a horror title. Sydney Sweeney impressed a few months ago with ***Anyone but You***, but it looks like that interest didn't translate here. Quite a mediocre performance for a horror film.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

The good news is that we'll have an uptick from this weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

20th Century Studios is releasing ***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes***, the next chapter in the reboot franchise. Set 300 years after the events of ***War***, it follows an ape who challenges the beliefs of the new ape king, Proximus Caesar, with the help of a young human girl. The ***Apes*** franchise has been one of the studio's most prized properties, and all (even the reviled Tim Burton reboot) have been successful. The previous film earned $490 million worldwide, so it will be interesting to see how much it earns in proximity.

&amp;#x200B;

We're also getting another release, albeit smaller. That's ***Not Another Church Movie***, a parody of Christian films starring Jamie Foxx, Kevin Daniels and Mickey Rourke. Don't expect much from here; Briarcliff is not a big studio, and the parody genre has been dead for years.",33,74

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle also drops over 70% from Sunday.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6    , Douban:  9.1

In its opening weekend Howl's Moving Castle swayed dominantly towards women with a 65-35 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings by a slightly bigger 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Just as Spy X Family, Howl's Moving Castle was doominated by the 20-30 age brackets albeit it did generaly sway a bit more towards older people above 30. Ratings wise there seems to be a concensus across the board with every age group giving it high ratings.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit falls further behind the top 2 on Monday.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.0  , Taopiaopiao: 9.4     , Douban: 5.6

In its opening weekend Formed Police Unit unsurprisingly swayed even more dominantly towards women than the animated movies with a huge 72-28 gender split in their favor. Wang Yibo bringing in its hardcore fanbase. Naturaly women have therefore also been way way way more favorable to the movie to a hilarious degree. I'm talking a 1.2-1.7 points sway in ratings between genders. 

The age group split for this one is way more balance with everything from 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40+ getting a 15-20% share. Only the below 20 bracket lagged behind with 6%. Ratings wise the really young teen groups and the older groups at 35+ rated the movie the highest with the in between viewing the movie less favorably.

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy drops to 2nd behind Twilight of The Warriors. Tomorrow it will pass Formed Police Unit in total gross.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.1     , Douban: 6.1

In its opening weekend The Last Frenzy swayed quite balanced but still in favor of women witn a 52-48 gender split in their favor. They have also been slightly more favorable to the movie in ratings by a 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Age brackets wise its somewhat dominated by the 20-30 brackets but also has a significant portion of older brackets pulling 15%. It is however almost non existent with under 20's which make up just a 2-3% margin. Ratings wise its rated quite evenly across all brackets.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre.

Deadline is nearly done with their Most Valuable Blockbuster Tournament for 2023 and already listed the biggest box office bombs from last year. This post attempts to estimate how much Fast X lost for Universal. I used Deadline's profit breakdowns for other movies from the Fast Saga as well as profit breakdowns from Deadline's 2023 Tournament. I estimate that Fast X lost **37.3M** for Universal. It was a flop but not an outright bomb. How does this compare to other movies from the Fast Saga? Fast and Furious 6 (+$135.1M), Furious 7 (+$354M), Fate of the Furious (+$113.4M), Hobbs &amp; Shaw (+$84M) and Fast 9 (+$45.7M) were all considerably more successful. As you can see, this saga has trended downwards since 2015. 

Sources: Deadline's profit breakdowns for Fast Saga. Links will be provided in the comments below. I will make posts for some of the other flops (not bombs) of 2023. ",20,9

I would propose that the shock and anxiety being felt right now is more a result of this being the first summer season without a Marvel launch since **2006**. We are in *totally* uncharted waters right now - the last time this happened, Netflix streaming wasn't even a thing yet and Blockbuster was still a regular part of many people's routines. 

So why didn't it get a better opening? Well, many have pointed to the marketing, being both overbearing and not terribly enticing as far as a clear hook or reason to rush out to the theater. Its stars, Blunt and Gosling, were both featured in last years Barbenheimer, but outside of that, neither of them have ever really been much of a draw - their last few films, *First Man* and *Jungle Cruise* both heavily underperformed.

Alright, well if it didn't have great marketing and neither of the stars are marketable, then why was it assumed that this was going to be a bigger hit? Just based on the concept? The release date? Could it be that maybe we assumed that having the 'summer kick-off' status meant more than it actually did? 

*Edge of Tomorrow*, another well-reviewed action title with Emily Blunt, also opened to $28M back in 2014, and was also largely seen then as the death of all originality in filmmaking - however, it ended up legging it out to $100M and doing decently well thanks to overseas/home video sales. Similarly, 2010's *Knight and Day* was another flashy action-comedy with two very recognizable stars and a by-the-numbers plot, which was, as well, seen as the death of 'movie stars' when it launched to a middling $25M in 2010 (https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-jun-19-la-fi-ct-cruise-20100619-story.html). 

The thing is, all of these are simply a continuation of what we were seeing throughout most of 2023, which is that safe bets aren't a thing anymore. Action comedies rarely opened well above $35M even before the pandemic, regardless of where they were placed on the release calendar. 

What's my point in all of this? **That this isn't the end of the world**. Less than a month ago we had a somewhat controversial A24 thriller open almost as high as this with roughly a third of the budget. Fresh, new, unique, and interesting is what people want - that's what made *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* such huge hits. So-called 'safe-bets' with over-bloated budgets were box office poison last year, and that hasn't changed. Maybe we won't have a $150M opening weekend at the beginning of May every year from now on, but we might also see more interesting, original films that actually get a chance to compete and play like real movies. There's still plenty of time left for the summer to recover. Let's see what happens. ",76,122

#**Labour Day Holidays Box Office (April 30th-5th)**

The Holidays have officialy come to an end today. They have pushed the yearly box office north of ¥20B. Hitting the milestone 3 days earlier than last year.

Formed Police Unit came out on top even if just barelly after bleeding the gap to The Last Frenzy for the last few days. Behind Twilight of the Warriors is also constantly catching up. 

Spy X Family records an increddible $32M ahead of Howl's Moving Castle which adds $16.7M

The holdovers i included both the Holiday period and the 3 day weekend gross and the % are the Weekend this week vs the weekend last week.

GxK and KFP4 have made a very good use of the Holidays. The Boy and The Heron less so.

**Pre-Sales map for tomorrow**

###**Spy X Family:**

Spy X Family completes its Holiday boosted opening hitting $32M. Enough to already put it 12th on the all time Japanese movies list.


**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban:  7.5(-0.1)

In its opening weekend Spy X Family swayed towards women with a 54-46 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings albeit with a tiny 0.1 poi nt different. 

The movie is predominantly leaning towards people in the 20-30 age bracket. These people have also naturaly been most favorable to the movie in reviews.

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle manages to comfortably clear $16M in the end. Might not be doing as good as pre-release expectations but these are still more than solid numbers for a 20 year old movie.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6    , Douban:  9.1

In its opening weekend Howl's Moving Castle swayed dominantly towards women with a 65-35 gender split in their favor. They have also been more favorable to the movie in ratings by a slightly bigger 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Just as Spy X Family, Howl's Moving Castle was doominated by the 20-30 age brackets albeit it did generaly sway a bit more towards older people above 30. Ratings wise there seems to be a concensus across the board with every age group giving it high ratings.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit manages to clinch the title of the Holiday champion just. Its gonna continue to drop off the top 2 going forward and will likely finish below both when all is said and done.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.0(-0.3)   , Taopiaopiao: 9.4(-0.1)     , Douban: 5.6

In its opening weekend Formed Police Unit unsurprisingly swayed even more dominantly towards women than the animated movies with a huge 72-28 gender split in their favor. Wang Yibo bringing in its hardcore fanbase. Naturaly women have therefore also been way way way more favorable to the movie to a hilarious degree. I'm talking a 1.2-1.7 points sway in ratings between genders. 

The age group split for this one is way more balance with everything from 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and 40+ getting a 15-20% share. Only the below 20 bracket lagged behind with 6%. Ratings wise the really young teen groups and the older groups at 35+ rated the movie the highest with the in between viewing the movie less favorably.

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy has to settle for 2nd but still puts in a good shift to reach $54M for its holiday opening. From here its gonna try and push for a $100M+ total.


**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.3   , Taopiaopiao: 9.1(-0.1)     , Douban: 6.1(-0.1)

In its opening weekend The Last Frenzy swayed quite balanced but still in favor of women witn a 52-48 gender split in their favor. They have also been slightly more favorable to the movie in ratings by a 0.2-0.3 point margin.

Age brackets wise its somewhat dominated by the 20-30 brackets but also has a significant portion of older brackets pulling 15%. It is however almost non existent with under 20's which make up just a 2-3% margin. Ratings wise its rated quite evenly across all brackets.

Godzilla X Kong exceeds $131M. After passing KoTM yesterday and pushing to 39th on the all time Holywood movie list with ¥947M it really has no other large milestones left besides maybe a push for 38th which is occupied by The Jungle Book(¥976M)

**Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes**

The Apes continue to trundle along towards its heavily compromised weekend. Its really hard to draw any comparisons here because of that. With Saturday being a work day both Friday and Saturday will massively suffer.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

- Added a few movies releasing in the next month and a half.

Now finding comparisons to Shin Godzilla is rather tricky. That film did see a release in Taiwan, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and Vietnam but I haven't been able to find data on how much it grossed in many markets or how many tickets it sold, let alone what it was up against.

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Mobile Suit Gundam SEED FREEDOM**

- Flip (Selling good compared to Spy X Family, but it has much less showings and no PLFs (May 2).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.89M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.42M EA+Thursday comp.  Keeps doing really well and rising against comps (May 2). This has been doing pretty consistently well (April 25). Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.13M EA comp and $5.76M EA+Thursday comp. Added Godzilla which brought the average way up (May 1).)

- keysersoze123 (Its going to open bigger than Fall Guy for sure. Not sure how wide the early shows are. But a EA gross around 1.5m could be in play. Previews we have to wait and see how it accelerates close to release (April 27). Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing close to a $90M opening weekend (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.36M Thursday comp. Starting to accelerate. Very good growth (May 3). Not even going to update Planet of the Apes because its growth has been pitiful (April 30).)

- Vafrow ($3.5M EA+Thursday comp.  Growth remains steady, letting it hold ground (May 4). Staying pretty steady (May 3). It is trending in the right direction right now (May 1). It actually had a decent day (April 29). Sales dropped by 3. Cancelled tickets for one of the shows it seems. It keeps getting worse (April 28). Continues to be sluggish (April 26). Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**IF Thursday comp: $2.01M**

- PROMOTIONS (APRIL 29 ONLY: Each purchased ticket with RegalMovies gifts a ticket to someone at 826. Regal offering 2500 rewards points.)

- abracadabra1998 ($0.83M Thursday comp. The release window for this is way shorter than all these comps so those numbers will naturally go up. Decent growth in the last three days (May 2). Comps are obviously silly at this stage, just wanted to show that unsurprisingly not really a lot of interest from a get-go. We shall see how it does in these coming weeks (April 29).)

- AniNate(I did see a surprising amount of single sales looking at IF charts (May 1). Gonna try some amateur local tracking: 55 tickets sold across 4 Cinemarks.  I feel like this level of unadulterated upfront interest is pretty notable for an original family movie (April 30).)

- charlie Jatinder (Hmm. So no real Regal impact it seems at katnisscinnaplex's theaters (April 30).)

- DAJK (Selling pretty well so far here (May 4).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.61M Thursday comp. 25 Regal sales (out of 45?) (April 30).)

-  TheFlatLannister ($3.28M Thursday comp. This is very good considering the lower amount of showings it has (April 30).)

- vafrow ($2.3M Thursday comp.  Numbers are still really low, making the standard track fairly useless. I did do a larger 100km radius track, encompassing the broader southern Ontaro market (~8M population, MTC4 being about 70-80% of the market). Even against Haunted Mansion, which underindexed here, it's not doing well (May 4). For a 100 km radius (which captures the whole broader region, probably about an 8M population base), it's sold 11 tickets. Still no sales locally (April 30). I think this only went up overnight, so it's not too odd to have zero sales (April 29).)

**The Strangers: Chapter 1 Thursday Comp: $1.89M**

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.89M Thursday comp)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.32M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.93M EA comp and $1.12M Thursday comp.  Seems like it'll be like Trolls where EA syphons off all the early sales. Very low sales will lead to big variance in these early days. Trolls ($1.63M) is the most useful Thursday comp due to similar EA situations (April 25).)

- el sid (The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.59M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales for my core sample for previews. But I did the larger sweep, which shows the interest right now is the Sunday early access shows. Looking at sales patterns, it's mainly blocks of 3/4 tickets, so likely families grabbing some. It's worth noting that the May holiday in Canada is the weekend of May 17-20th, not the weekend after with Memorial Day. I can see families prioritizing getting out the holiday weekend when they have more time (May 4). Still no sales (April 28). Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- katnisscinnaplex (Just for kicks I took a look at the LotR re-releases scheduled for June.  They're getting one show each (for the most part) in around 1k theaters. Some locations already adding a second showing (April 30). Looks to be in around 1k theaters.   Sales looking good already as expected (I already got mine!) (April 26).)

Do you have an AMC-A List, Regal, or any movie theater subscription ticket service to watch movies in theaters or do you pay for each movie ticket? Just with the initial box office of The Fall Guy an idea spurred in my head on if I didn’t have a subscription ticket service would I still have paid money to watch The Fall Guy? (The answer is no) 

Maybe that’s part of my understanding of certain movies would succeed. For the vast majority of audiences that more than likely don’t have a movie theater subscription service would they still be interested in buying a ticket for The Fall Guy or a Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire? And maybe that feeds into the type of marketplace we might be at for movies that are not family oriented (Super Mario or Despicable Me) or event movies like DUNE or BARBIE.

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Danny Boyle's turn.

Boyle was an altar boy for eight years and his mother had the priesthood in mind for him, but at the age of 14 he was persuaded by a priest not to transfer to a seminary. He studied English and drama at the University College of North Wales, where he directed several productions for the student drama society. He moved on to theater, as well as TV productions. But after watching *Apocalypse Now*, he knew he found his calling in cinema.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**Shallow Grave (1994)**

*""What's a little murder between friends?""*

His directorial debut. It stars Ewan McGregor, Christopher Eccleston, and Kerry Fox. Its plot follows a group of flatmates in Edinburgh who set off a chain of events after dismembering and burying a mysterious new tenant who died and left behind a large sum of money.

Shooting lasted for thirty days. The tight budgetary restraints during filming meant many of the props had to be auctioned off for them to afford sufficient film stock. Boyle claimed that Christopher Eccleston was so afraid of getting locked in a real-life mortuary for a scene, he had to ask a crew member to stand in the shadows and comfort the nervous actor.

Despite a first-time writer and director, the film found great success. It earned $19.8 million through a very successful run in Europe. It also received a very solid response. Boyle was just getting started.

- **Budget:** $2,500,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,079,569.

- **Worldwide gross:** $19,879,569.

#**Trainspotting (1996)**

*""Choose life.""*

His second film. Based on the novel by Irvine Welsh, it stars Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle, and Kelly Macdonald. The film follows a group of heroin addicts in an economically depressed area of Edinburgh and their passage through life. Beyond drug addiction, other themes in the film include an exploration of the urban poverty and squalor in Edinburgh.

Producer Andrew Macdonald read Irvine Welsh's book on a plane, and felt that it could be made into a film. He turned it on to Boyle, who was excited by its potential to be the ""most energetic film you've ever seen — about something that ultimately ends up in purgatory or worse"". John Hodge read it and made it his goal to ""produce a screenplay which would seem to have a beginning, a middle and an end, would last 90 minutes and would convey at least some of the spirit and the content of the book.""

The film received critical acclaim for its directing, acting, humor, soundtrack, and themes, and it was subsequently ranked as one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It was also a huge box office success, earning over $70 million worldwide and lifting Boyle's profile. The film's release sparked controversy in some countries, including Britain, Australia and the United States, as to whether or not it promoted and romanticised drug use. U.S. Senator Bob Dole accused it of moral depravity and glorifying drug use during the 1996 U.S. presidential campaign, although he later admitted that he had not seen the film. But despite that, it received an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

- **Budget:** $2,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $16,501,785.

- **Worldwide gross:** $71,548,935.

#**A Life Less Ordinary (1997)**

*""A twisted love story.""*

His third film. It stars Ewan McGregor, Cameron Diaz, Holly Hunter, Delroy Lindo, Ian Holm and Dan Hedaya. The plot follows two angels who are sent to Earth to help make a disgruntled kidnapper and his hostage fall in love.

While Boyle and Hodge hit gold with their previous films, that wasn't the case here. The film was panned for its comedy, story and tone. And despite having a big studio involved, it made less than their previous films and bombed.

- **Budget:** $12,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $4,287,595.

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,633,270.

#**The Beach (2000)**

*""Somewhere on this planet, it must exist.""*

His fourth film. Based on the novel by Alex Garland, it stars stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, Virginie Ledoyen, Guillaume Canet, and Robert Carlyle. It follows Richard, a young man who travels to Thailand and finds himself in possession of an odd map. Rumours state that the map leads to an island paradise. Accompanied by a few friends, he sets out to find it.

Ewan McGregor was cast as the main character before leaving due to disputes with the director. It was speculated that Boyle was offered additional funding under the condition that DiCaprio be cast and his character made American. McGregor said it was simply a misunderstanding, while Boyle reportedly apologized for his treatment.

The film received mainly negative reviews; critics derided it for its writing, characters and acting. The film disappointed in the United States, but it was successful in the rest of the world, earning $144 million worldwide, so it was still a box office success.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $39,785,027.

- **Worldwide gross:** $144,056,873.

#**28 Days Later (2002)**

*""The days are numbered.""*

His fifth film. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns, and Brendan Gleeson. It follows a bicycle courier who awakens from a coma to discover the accidental release of a highly contagious, aggression-inducing virus has caused the breakdown of society. 

Alex Garland was inspired by the George Romero films *Night of the Living Dead* and *Dawn of the Dead*, which he loved as a child but said that he had largely forgotten about the zombie genre until he played the video game *Resident Evil*, which reminded him how much he loved zombies after ""having not really encountered zombies for quite a while"". Boyle liked Garland's screenplay for a proposed zombie film, and he decided to collaborate. Despite that, neither Boyle nor Garland refer to the creatures as ""zombies"".

Despite not carrying a high budget, the producers were able to close off sections of street for minutes at a time, usually in early morning before sunrise on Sundays. They typically had around 45 minutes after dawn to shoot the locations devoid of traffic and members of the public. This allowed them to film at the Westminster Bridge, Piccadilly Circus, Horse Guards Parade and Oxford Street. The 9/11 attacks took place during filming, and Boyle noted the parallel between the ""missing persons"" flyers seen at the beginning of the film and similar flyers posted in New York City in the wake of the attacks. Boyle said his crew probably would not have been granted permission to close off Whitehall for filming after the terrorist attacks.

At a certain point, producer Andrew Macdonald announced to the crew that the production had run out of money. Filming ceased without a closing sequence being shot. After pitching several different ideas for an ending and the original ending which featured Jim's death tested badly with audiences, the studio granted more funding to film the ending scene that was eventually used. The crew organised for a real jet to fly overhead for them to film, as this was cheaper than approximately £70,000 for a computer-generated one.

After two poorly received films, Boyle bounced back with an acclaimed film. And it also proved to be a success at the box office, earning $84 million worldwide. The film was also named as a huge influence on the zombie genre, even though Boyle and Garland aren't using the term. A sequel, *28 Weeks Later*, was released on 2007, but neither Boyle nor Garland returned for their roles.

- **Budget:** $8,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $45,064,915.

- **Worldwide gross:** $84,661,434.

#**Millions (2004)**

*""Can anyone be truly good?""*

His sixth film. Based on the novel by Frank Cottrell Boyce, it stars Alex Etel, Lewis Owen McGibbon, and James Nesbitt. Set in England just before British adoption of the euro, the story features two boys who must decide what to do with a windfall in expiring currency.

It received favorable reviews, and was another success for Boyle.

- **Budget:** N/A.

- **Domestic gross:** $6,584,159.

- **Worldwide gross:** $11,782,282.

#**Sunshine (2007)**

*""If it dies, so do we.""*

His seventh film. It stars Cillian Murphy, Chris Evans, Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cliff Curtis, Troy Garity, Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong, Chipo Chung, and Mark Strong. Set in the year 2057, the sun is dying and a group of astronauts embark on a dangerous mission to reignite it.

After a project focused on the 1999 Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire was scrapped, Boyle started looking for new scripts. He found Alex Garland's script for *Sunshine*, and decided that this should be his next film. Producer Andrew Maconald took it to 20th Century Fox, but they declined as they found it similar to their box office flop *Solaris*, so Searchlight took it instead. Since the preliminary budget at $40 million was too demanding for Searchlight, Macdonald sought outside financing from British lottery funds, U.K. rebates, and outside investor Ingenious Film Partners.

Garland was inspired to write the film based on scientific ideas about the heat death of the universe. Garland had wondered about what would result from the Sun's death after reading in an American scientific periodical ""an article projecting the future of mankind from a physics-based, atheist perspective"". To shape the science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired scientific advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists such as Brian Cox (not that one). Despite consulting on the accuracy, Cox was not annoyed by the creative liberties with the logic (one single nuclear stellar bomb wouldn't be enough to reignite the sun), also asking critics to not think much of it.

Boyle and Garland worked on the script for a year, spent a second year preparing for production, filmed for three months, and spent a third full year editing and completing visual effects. After completion of filming, Boyle said that he would not revisit the science fiction genre, citing production as a spiritually exhausting experience. The director said making the film had conquered his fear of the difficulty encountered in producing a science fiction film, and that he would move on from the genre.

Boyle chose to have an ensemble cast to encourage a more democratic process, similar to the ensemble cast in *Alien*. Boyle also chose to have the cast be international in order to reflect the mission's purpose ""on behalf of all mankind."" Boyle desired to capture a sense of togetherness among the actors by assigning them to live together. He also enrolled the cast members in space training and scuba diving, as well as watching films together.

The film received great reviews from critics, although there were polarized reactions towards the film's tonal shift in the final act. But despite a big budget for a prestige studio, the film was a box office dud.

- **Budget:** $40,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $3,675,753.

- **Worldwide gross:** $34,806,812.

#**Slumdog Millionaire (2008)**

*""What does it take to find a lost love? A. Money B. Luck C. Smarts D. Destiny""*

His eighth film. Loosely based on the novel *Q&amp;A* by Vikas Swarup, it stars Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Madhur Mittal, Anil Kapoor and Irrfan Khan. It narrates the story of 18-year-old Jamal Malik from the Juhu slums of Mumbai. As a contestant on an Indian-Hindi version of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*, Jamal surprises everyone by answering every question correctly so far, winning ₹1 crore (US$120,000), and he is one question away from winning the grand prize of ₹2 crore (US$240,000). Accused of cheating, he recounts his life story to the police, illustrating how he was able to answer each question.

After reading the novel, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy made three research trips to India and interviewed street children, finding himself impressed with their attitudes. The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: ""I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums. What you pick up on is this mass of energy."" Boyle was approached over directing the film, but he didn't want to make a film on *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*. But he changed his mind when he found that Beaufoy was involved, as *The Full Monty* was one of his favorite films.

The film was inspired by Indian cinema, and Boyle even decided to have more dialogue in Hindi. The rags-to-riches, underdog theme was also a recurring theme in classic Bollywood movies from the 1950s through to the 1980s, when ""India worked to lift itself from hunger and poverty."" Other classic Bollywood tropes in the film include ""the fantasy sequences"" and the montage sequence where ""the brothers jump off a train and suddenly they are seven years older"".

The producers wanted Prem Kumar to be played by Shahrukh Khan, an established Bollywood star and host of the 2007 series of *Kaun Banega Crorepati* (the Indian version of *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?*). However, Khan turned down the role, concerned that he did not want to give his audience the impression that the real show was a fraud by playing a fraudulent host in the movie. In subsequent years, and despite the film's success, he said he does not regret turning it down, although he has also supported the film from criticism.

The film received critical acclaim, and was quickly named as one of the greatest films of the 2000s. But it didn't stop just with the acclaim, it was also a colossal hit with the audience. The film built insane word-of-mouth across the world, passing *The Beach* to become Boyle's highest grossing film. It closed its run with a colossal $378 million worldwide, which made it the highest grossing Searchlight film ever (a record it still maintains). 

At the Oscars, it received 10 nominations and won a leading 8: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, and Best Sound Mixing. Boyle was finally an Oscar-winning director.

- **Budget:** $15,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $141,319,928.

- **Worldwide gross:** $378,411,362.

#**127 Hours (2010)**

*""Every second counts.""*

His ninth film. It stars James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, and Clémence Poésy. In the film, canyoneer Aron Ralston must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003.

Boyle decided to team up with Simon Beaufoy again on an Aron Ralston biopic, and the project marked his first writing credit. He wanted Cillian Murphy as Ralston, but he got James Franco instead. Boyle made the very unusual move of hiring two cinematographers to work first unit, Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, each of whom shot 50 percent of the film by trading off with each other. This allowed Boyle and Franco to work long days without wearing out the crew. Franco said that the experience was frustrating, as he not only had to endure pain, but also feel exhaustion from standing on the same spot for hours.

There were some reports that many audience members felt sick while watching the amputation scene. But it didn't prevent the film from becoming a box office success, hitting $60 million worldwide. It was also critically acclaimed. It received 6 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay.

- **Budget:** $18,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $18,335,230.

- **Worldwide gross:** $60,738,797.

#**Trance (2013)**

*""Inside the man outside the law.""*

His tenth film. It stars James McAvoy, Vincent Cassel and Rosario Dawson, and follows an employee at an auction house who loses his memory after he steals an irreplaceable piece of art. His partner sends him to a therapist in order to retrace his steps and find the missing painting.

The film received mixed reviews for its thin writing and was a box office bomb.

- **Budget:** $20,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,328,743.

- **Worldwide gross:** $24,261,569.

#**Steve Jobs (2015)**

*""Can a great man be a good man?""*

His 11th film. It stars Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Katherine Waterston, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Jeff Daniels. The film covers fourteen years in the life of Steve Jobs, specifically ahead of three press conferences he gave during that time - the formal unveiling of the Macintosh 128K on January 24, 1984; the unveiling of the NeXT Computer on October 12, 1988; and the unveiling of the iMac G3 on May 6, 1998.

When Walter Isaacson published the biography book based on Jobs' life, Sony quickly bought the film rights with Aaron Sorkin writing. Sorkin was not interested in covering the entirety of Jobs' life; he preferred to set the film around 3 important periods of his life. But most importantly, it had to explore Jobs' relationship with a few key people: Steve Wozniak, Joanna Hoffman, John Sculley, Andy Hertzfeld, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, and Chrisann Brennan. Sorkin had a chance to speak with all of them while developing the screenplay, although the dialogue would still be fiction.

David Fincher was approached to direct, and he wanted Christian Bale to play Jobs. However, he left due to contract disputes. When Boyle signed, Bale, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and Bradley Cooper were considered for the role. Eventually, Michael Fassbender was chosen.

The film received critical acclaim, and was named as one of the best films of 2015. On limited release, it opened with $521,522 in 4 theaters ($130,380 per-theater average), showing strong promise. But it disappointed on its wide release with just $7 million. Despite the acclaim and great word-of-mouth, it quickly crashed and closed with just $34 million worldwide, making it a box office flop. Boyle expressed disappointment at the box office performance, while suggesting that Universal expanded the film's release ""too wide too soon"" and that the studio's move was ""arrogant.""

- **Budget:** $30,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $17,766,658.

- **Worldwide gross:** $34,441,873.

#**T2 Trainspotting (2017)**

*""Face your past. Choose your future.""*

His 12th film. The sequel to *Trainspotting* and loosely based on *Porno* by Irvine Welch, it stars Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Shirley Henderson, James Cosmo, and Kelly Macdonald. After 20 years, Mark Renton returns to Edinburgh to reunite with his old friends. However, things do not go as planned when he joins his best friend, Simon, and his lover to start a brothel.

10 years after the original was released, Boyle expressed interest in adapting *Porno*, but he wanted the cast to age so they would ""look ravaged"" as the story needed it. In 2015, Boyle decided to get John Hodge back as the writer, although he said the film would only be ""loosely based"" on *Porno*, as he felt that the book was not great compared to the original.

The film received a positive response from critics and audiences. It earned $41 million worldwide, which was less than what the original did 20 years prior.

- **Budget:** $18,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $2,402,004.

- **Worldwide gross:** $41,681,746.

#**Yesterday (2019)**

*""Everyone in the world has forgotten the Beatles. Everyone except Jack.""*

His 13th film. It stars Himesh Patel, Lily James, Joel Fry, Ed Sheeran, and Kate McKinnon. It follows struggling musician Jack Malik who suddenly finds himself as the only person who remembers the Beatles and becomes famous for performing their songs.

Jack Barth had been struggling to sell screenplays for decades. He conceived the story when it occurred to him that if *Star Wars* had not been created and he conceived it, he would not be able to sell it. In Barth's script, a ""meditation on professional disappointment"", Jack did not find success with the Beatles songs. Barth left the project, and Richard Curtis was subequently brought in to rewrite it, so he decided to make it a romantic comedy instead. When Boyle signed to direct, he informed the surviving members and widows of the Beatles about the film and received a reply he described as ""lovely"" from drummer Ringo Starr.

The film received a warm response from critics, but was much more successful with audiences. Thanks to a killer premise and efficient marketing campaign, the film grossed $154 million worldwide, making it Boyle's second highest grossing film.

But the film's impact didn't stop there.

Ana de Armas was announced to join the film, and she even filmed her scenes. Her role was a new love interest for Jack, and she is seen in the trailers. Her scenes were cut as test audiences felt it made Jack less sympathetic. As she was on some trailers, this led to a $5 million lawsuit when two fans claimed they were ""duped into renting the [$3.99] movie because she [de Armas] was in the trailer"". U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson allowed the class-action lawsuit to proceed in December 2022, stating that ""At its core, a trailer is an advertisement designed to sell a movie by providing consumers with a preview of the movie."" Wilson later dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that the ""injury is self-inflicted"" and thus no standing to sue. The two men settled with Universal over court fees by April 2024.

- **Budget:** $26,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $73,286,650.

- **Worldwide gross:** $154,608,856.

#**Other Projects**

Boyle has also worked on some British shows, directing a few episodes. He also directed *Trust*, an FX miniseries about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III. And recently, he directed *Pistol*, a miniseries focused on the Sex Pistols.

He was attached to direct *No Time to Die*, Daniel Craig's final film as James Bond. But shortly before filming started, Boyle exited the film over creative differences. He wanted the film to focus more on Bond's childhood, which was disapproved by the producers, and he also struggled in convincing them over his take in the character's death. He was subsequently replaced by Cary Joji Fukunaga.

#**The Future**

After so many years of development hell and delays, it's finally happening: Boyle is set to direct *28 Years Later*. It will be the first part in a planned trilogy, distributed by Sony and each film costing $75 million. Alex Garland will return to write the script for the whole trilogy, and Boyle will direct the first part (with Nia DaCosta directing the second film). Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Ralph Fiennes will star in the first film, with Cillian Murphy also expressing interest in returning.

#**The Verdict**

Despite some bombs, Boyle has proved to be a very reliable and versatile director at the box office. Even his bombs have found success in home media and streaming (otherwise we wouldn't get a *28 Years Later* trilogy). By far, one of Britain's most iconic directors. Nearly all of his films carry fantastic soundtracks as well. No bomb can stop him, and we gotta be thankful for that.

Hope you liked this edition. You can find this and more in the [wiki for this section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)

The next director will be **Wes Craven**. A horror legend.

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... &gt;!Richard Donner.!&lt; A director with so much range.

This is the schedule for the following four:

Week | Director | Reasoning
:-------:|:--------:|----------
May 6-12 | Wes Craven | A horror legend.
May 13-19 | Clint Eastwood | Great actor. Great director.
May 20-26 | Robert Zemeckis | Can we get old Zemeckis back?
May 27-June 2 | Richard Donner | An influential figure of the 70s and 80s.

Who should be next after Donner? That's up to you.",26,82

On the Japanese front with Spy X Family and Howl's Moving Castle now out Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

So loads of Japanese content ariving to China in the next few months.

**Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes**

Unfortunately for the Apes Saturday is a work day to compensate for the current Holidays so the Weekend will be deflated quite a lot which explains the weaker than expected pre-sales.

It continues trundling along at a slow pace in light of that.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

- Added a few movies releasing in the next month and a half.

Typically, an MCU film opens on the first weekend of May, with 2007, 2009 and 2014 having a non MCU film open, but still based on a Marvel character with X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Due to the strikes, we won't have a Marvel film be the top grossing on the first weekend of may for the first time since 2006, which had Mission Impossible 3. Here we will look at each weekend since 2007 and see how much it made, and we will see how much a non-Marvel weekend can do. Data is from The Numbers.

Every weekend has a combined gross in the 200 millions, with a few going a little bit over or under, but still averagely around that mark, and each has a film grossing $100m+ except for 2011 with Thor. Now we look at 2024. Thinking to yourself ""Thor Seems Low""? well The Fall Guy is looking to open to...

$30-35 million, according to Variety.

That is absolutely horrible, the lowest non-COVID year since 2005 with ""Kingdom of Heaven"" opening to just $25m and a combined weekend of $113,072,735. The only other wide releases are Star Wars: The Phantom Menace rerelease and Tarot, which could lead to this weekend being lower than 2005s. I am currently collecting data and will make a post when we get the results.",7,14

https://preview.redd.it/hi994u9yceyc1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02098d7bfbeb7fee12a274df2a84934c5c4aa5fe

In 2019, the updated “live-action” version of THE LION KING grossed $543M, making it the second highest grossing film of the year behind AVENGERS: ENDGAME. On Monday, Disney gave us a first look at the prequel MUFASA: THE LION KING with a poster and trailer drop. 

As expected, early in the week, prior to the trailer release, MUFASA generated little in the way of unaided awareness. But as the week went along, those numbers started to increase. By late Thursday night, MUFASA had accumulated an impressive 2% unaided. It’s possible that as more people discover the trailer, the number will continue to rise. So don’t be surprised if MUFASA registers more than 2% next week. 

For the second week in a row, DEADPOOL &amp; WOLVERINE registered the highest unaided of the week at 7%. THE FALL GUY held steady at 4% for a second week, placing it 4th among all films. We expect unaided to rise in the final week. The fact that FALL was flat does not bode well for its opening weekend.

Hope you’re doing well.

I should note, I am not hugely knowledgeable about this, so there may be a lot of ignorance.

It seems counterproductive to keep spending lavish amounts of money on just about every production when they have been struggling against some of their competitors (namely WB and Universal) and having several movies which have made much less than expected.

For instance, *Beauty and the Beast (2017)* made over a billion dollars worldwide and, two years later, *The Lion King* made over $1.5 billion and *Aladdin* made over a billion, but they (especially their live-action remakes) have struggled (to various degrees) post-pandemic. 

*The Little Mermaid (2023)* did somewhat respectable business (all things considered, including the economic situation after the pandemic), but it was still disappointing considering at least $250 was spent on it (not including marketing).

I should also say this is from a more casual box office analysis perspective and the reason I am asking the question here is because it seems strange from the outside looking in and many of you people will know way more about this than me.

I would think it would be smarter to spend less and try to make more, but, I guess, what do I know? Please enlighten me.

**SYNOPSIS:**

He’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right?

From real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy.

Oscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.

While the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.

Inspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once).

***The Strangers: Chapter 1***

I think this could potentially break out with horror fans and the original made over 50M.

***MaXXXine***

Pearl and X didn't gross much during their release in 2022. However, both films have retained their relevance these past two years. The TikTok crowd loves them, and I'm seeing hype for this from that crowd. 

***Trap***

While Knock at the Cabin only hit 35M, Old made 48M during 2021, and this has quite the hook to it. I can envision the songs from this going viral and boosting the box office.

***Fly Me To The Moon***

Channing Tatum had success in 2022 with both Dog and The Lost City being box office hits. Mix that in with Johansson's star power I can see this going above No Hard Feelings numbers.

***It Ends With Us***

From what I understand the book is very popular, so maybe it can be a Crawdads (probably not) but it's got potential.",16,24

**Kung Fu Panda 4** adds another strong $0.45M and climbs back into the top 10 today. Tomorrow it will pass $50M exceeding the likes of Across The Spider-Verse, Mission Impossible Dead Reckoning, Ant Man 3 and quite a few others that failed to hit this milestone in recent history.

Spy X Family continues to perform very well.

Projected total through Sunday might not hit $33M+ but its still well on track for the low 30's.

###**Formed Police Unit**

Formed Police Unit slips to 2nd today after adding $10.49M. History is repeating itself from last year with a Wang Yibo movie lauching top and then getting overtaken by a comedy movie shorty after release which then goes on to outgross the Wang Yibo movie. 

Happened last year with Born to Fly and GODSPEED and its happening this year with Formed Police Unit and The Last Frenzy.

Projected total through Sunday now probably looking closer to $55M+ instead of $60M

###**The Boy and the Heron**

The Boy and The Heron does ok. The recovery yesterday just wasn't big enough. Its gonna be so so close with Suzume in the end but The Boy and The Heron is looking to just miss out by arond $1.5M or less once all is said and done.

Godzilla X Kong meanwhile continues to do much better. Another $1M+ sees it on the verge of $130M which it will cross tomorrow.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes on May 10th, The Fall Guy on May 17th and Inside Out on June 21st.

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June.

On the Japanese front with Spy X Family and Howl's Moving Castle now out Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

There are rumors of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom releasing in China sometimes in May and My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! The Movie will also release at some point.

So loads of Japanese content ariving to China in the next few months.

**Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes**

Replaced Transformers with The Flash as that is clearly not happening. 

I'm sticking with the rest for now purelly on the fact that Saturday is a work day to compensate for the current Holidays so the Weekend will be deflated quite a lot which explains the weaker than expected pre-sales.

I don't think this movie is actually doing sub $10M like the pre-sales are currently suggesting.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

- Added a few movies releasing in the next month and a half.

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

Last week, **Challengers** officially became the highest opening for acclaimed director Luca Guadagnino and helped solidify Zendaya as a box office pull, even if actuals did not exactly meet my expectations.  With the power of tennis and social media thurst traps, Challengers came in nearly spot on to my **$1.43M Thurs** prediction.  Sadly, the Friday actuals came in slightly below my **$4.90M** expectation.  Still, not a deal breaker as actuals were not too fat behind my **$6.83M** **Thurs+Fri** opening day guesstimate.  Is this the opening that will save Hollywood?  No, but it is a good refresher that stars can still open original, arthouse movies.  With stellar, viral word of mouth, Challengers might just be able to see green against its oddly hefty **$55M** price-tag.

Welcome to the official 2024 Summer Box Office season!!  Don't be confused.  There is indeed NO Marvel film coming out on this first weekend of May.  You can thank the dual writers/actors strike for that.  Instead, studios have pivoted to a light season kick-off with a big-starred action title and a counter-programming horror.  First up is Universal's **The Fall Guy** trying to capitalize on the opening Summer slot after an initial March 2024 date.  While the action pic is based on an 80s television show, the IP is old and irrelevant enough that this will be more of a test of stars and the rom-com genre on general audiences.  Good thing director David Leitch has had successful experience in the genre with **Bullet Train** from two Summers ago.  As a fellow star-driven action title, we will use **The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warefare** , which we will use a comp.  Trying to grab the younger audiences, Sony Pictures is coming with their PG-13 original, **Tarot**.  Despite Horrorscope being a much better name, Tarot is here to grab the young horror fans while the market is vacant for May.  As an teen-skewing horror title, we will use **Thanksgiving** as a comp.  I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

Welp, it's no Marvel, but that's okay...for now.  To be honest, the mute growth of sales over the growth are quite concerning, but the last minute walk-ups show signs of hope for this one to breakout against the dwindling expectations.  Currently, Thursday is on track for **$1.66M** compared to TMoUW (**Things to Note:** There were Early Access screenings that will be added in later).  Admittedly, this number is a bit concerning as the big kick off to the Summer season.  Friday is not looking much better with **$6.07M** compared to TMoUW.  Even the theater capacities are rather light falling behind TMoUW.  Granted, that is due to TFG having many more showtimes without as big of an audience to match it.  Despite these rather cautious red flags, there is some confidence out there.  Not only are sales for Saturday healthy, but this is a rom-com so it is prime for date night.  Also, this is still a relatively ""original"" title so there is not usually a huge immediate fan rush.  As long as the word of mouth is healthy, which it seems to be, the people will hear and more will come.

For non-IP horror, Tarot's ticket sales feel rather standard.  Not only are these numbers low to start, but the growth throughout the week is just as uneven as always.  Still, there is the usual ""last-minute"" walk-up surge, which is just par per the course.  At this rate, Tarot is hoping to unleash a **$.84M** Thursday compared to Thanksgiving.  Sadly, Friday is looking to be just as cursed with **$2.69M** compared to Thanksgiving.  Can we be that surprised when marketing was extremely bare bones?  Despite a slew of horror titles so far this year, none of broken out, so it is to no surprise the lightly marketed Tarot would break the curse.  With minimal showings, the theater capacities are decent, with Theater 1, a more horror and walk-up friendly audience, showing stronger life of sales and demand.  Even compared to Thanksgiving, Tarot is lagging behind in demand at Theater 2, which might signify a lack of adult interest.  Clearly, Sony is dumping this movie with barebones effort put in to getting the word out, but as long as their budgets are low, with these numbers, we can't really complain.

Overall, this brings The Fall Guy to a **$8.48M** Wed+Th+F opening. For Tarot, it seems to be playing to mostly dead crowds with a Th+Fri **$3.53M** opening. After a light April, we really could've used a breakout here.  If these numbers hold, The Fall Guy is looking at an opening of **$23M**, while Tarot will deal out a weekend of **$9M.** Not saying it is totally over for The Fall Guy, but it will need to do some serious recovery to make up for its **$130M** budget.  On the other hand, Sony seems to be just fine with Tarot's paltry **$8M** price-tag.  This Summer was always destined to be down, but the strikes really messed things up.  Over course this start is no Guardians 3, but hopefully audiences branch out and find their next Barbenhiemer these next couple of months.

TLDR:

**The Fall Guy:**

Wednesday: **$.75M**

Thursday: **$1.66M**

Friday: **$6.07M**

Opening Day: **$8.48M**

**Tarot:**

Thursday: **$.84M**

Friday: **$2.69M**

Opening Day: **$3.53M**",5,23

* Due to Wednesday being a holiday in Germany, The Fall Guy opened on Tuesday and the other Newcomers opened on Wednesday.

So, the projected Opening Weekend Number for The Fall Guy (Ca. 200,000 tickets) includes it´s Tuesday &amp; Wednesday numbers, which definitely inflates it´s numbers. It´s projected number for the actual Opening Weekend would probably be closer to Ca. 130,000 tickets - Ca. 150,000 tickets.

Anyway, including it´s numbers from Tuesday &amp; wednesday, The Fall Guy is aiming to have the 4th Biggest Opening Weekend of 2024 &amp; the 56th Biggest Opening Weekend since the Pandemic started. However, it would be way lower on both Lists if i had the Projections for the normal 4-Day Weekend.

**Top 10 Biggest 2024 Opening Weekends:**

1. Dune: Part Two - 608,371 tickets

2. Chantal in Fairyland - 576,148 tickets

3. Kung Fu Panda 4 – 297,620 tickets

4. The Fall Guy - Ca. 200,000 tickets (including Tuesday Opening Day &amp; Wednesday)

5. Anyone But You – 192,573 tickets

6. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire – 180,103 tickets

7. The Beekeeper – 165,381 tickets

8. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire – 164,496 tickets

9. Disney Channel Interactive Cinema 2024 – 160,383 tickets

10. Eine Million Minuten – 159,185 tickets

Dropped Out: Autumn and the Black Jaguar – 142,605 tickets

* The Fall Guy is also set to  have the 3rd Biggest Opening Weekends from Ryan Gosling &amp; David Leitch.

**Top 5 Biggest Ryan Gosling Opening Weekends:**

1. Barbie - 621,560 tickets
2. Blade Runner 2049 - 247,588 tickets
3. The Fall Guy - Ca. 200,000 tickets (including Tuesday Opening Day &amp; Wednesday)
4. La La Land – 138,298 tickets
5. Fracture – 128,674 tickets

Dropped Out: Crazy, Stupid, Love – 117,994 tickets

**Top 5 Biggest David Leitch Opening Weekends:**  
1. Deadpool 2 - 661,078 tickets

2. Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs and Shaw - 491,783 tickets

3. The Fall Guy - Ca. 200,000 tickets (including Tuesday Opening Day &amp; Wednesday)

4. John Wick - 141,537 tickets

5. Bullet Train - 123,767 tickets

Dropped Out: Atomic Blonde - 75,379 tickets

* Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace´s 25th Anniversary Re-Release is off to a very sucessful start and is set to have the 2nd Biggest Opening Weekend of a Re-Release during the 2020s, only below Avatar´s 2022 Re-Release.

However unlike the Re-Releases listed below it will only be in theaters for 5 days (May 1st, 2024-May 5th, 2024), while the other ones were in theaters for multiple weeks.

**Top 4 Biggest 2020s Re-Release Opening Weekends:**

1. Avatar (2022 Re-Release) - 111,332 tickets

2. Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace (25th Anniversary Re-Release) - Ca. 75,000 tickets (including Wednesday Opening Day)

3. Titanic (2023 Re-Release) - 52,403 tickets

4. Dune (2024 Re-Release) - 20,097 tickets

* This projection should be treated with caution, because due to Wednesday being a holiday, thursday´s numbers were more like the numbers from a monday, resulting in easily the worst Thursday of the Year. So due to this, the Weekend is probably gonna have bigger multipliers than usual, the question is gonna be how much.

The German Fantasy/ Comedy Film: ""Chantal in Fairyland"" is set to lose it´s 1st place in it´s 6th Weekend.

And Callengers is aiming to increase +7.9% in it´s 2nd Weekend.

**The current projection for the Weekend:**

1. The Fall Guy - 200,000 tickets (including Tuesday Opening Day &amp; Wednesday) (New)

2. Chantal in Fairyland - 87,500 tickets -30.2%/ 2,365,000 (6th Weekend)

3. Star Wars: Episode 1 The Phantom Menace (25th Anniversary Re-Release) - 75,000 tickets (including Wednesday Opening Day) (New)

4. Challengers - 55,000 tickets +7.9%/ 142,500 tickets (2nd Weekend)

5. Back to Black - 45,000 tickets -32.6%/ 422,500 tickets (4th Weekend)

?. Max and the Wild Bunch: The Ghostly Granny - 40,000 tickets (including Wednesday Opening Day &amp; Sunday Previews) (New)

?. Knock Knock Knock - 27,500 tickets (including Previews) (New)

?. Giants of la Mancha - 20,000 tickets (including Wednesday Opening Day &amp; Sunday Previews) (New)

* Of course, this is only a projection based on the Thursday &amp; Wednesday numbers of these films, so these numbers can still change in the coming days.

My next post, about this Weekend´s Final Numbers will be released next Week, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday.",1,14

- These are the only ones reported by Deadline. Deadline only does top 5 of the year, so maybe other movies could've end up here, but sadly there's not enough information.

- Of course, we have no data for 2020 and 2021 because Deadline didn't make a Most Valuable Tournament, so these won't be included. So we'll never know how much *Dolittle*, *Onward*, *The Last Duel*, *The Suicide Squad* or *Chaos Walking* lost.

- I also included *World War Z* [after finally finding its full data](https://issuu.com/pmcderek/docs/2013_most_valuable_blockbuster_tour), so it will be a bonus.

This post attempts to estimate the studio profit for The Dark Knight Rises. I used the Deadline profit breakdowns for Man of Steel, Iron Man 3, Interstellar and Oppenheimer as comparisons. I estimate that The Dark Knight Rises had a profit of **$220.1M** for WB. That makes it the 4th most profitable DC film of the past 15 years after Joker ($437M), Aquaman 1 ($260.5M) and Wonder Woman ($252.9M). This also makes it the most profitable Nolan movie since Inception.

- abracadabra1998 ($0.52M Thursday comp. Also a really good jump, maybe indicative of good walk-ups. I'll go with a final prediction of $550k, +/-100 (May 1). Probably settle around $400-500k unless this has crazy last-minute growth (April 30). Still doing absolutely nothing (April 25). Now at 6 tickets sold lol (April 21). Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- crazymoviekid ($0.61M Thursday comp and $1.55M Friday comp. Leveling off at $1M Thursday and looking around $1.5M-$2M Friday (April 30).)

- el sid ($0.63M Thursday comp. So the comp improved by 100k since yesterday and I think that positive trend will continue till tomorrow so I say 700k+ from previews and with good walks-ups high single digits could still happen. Up 61.5% since yesterday. A nice last-minute improvement (May 2). Up for a horror film horrible 18% since Monday (May 1). Not even that bad. The quite good sales in California help. Of course, with so uneven comps we have to take that number with a grain of salt (April 29). So not too great but also no disaster in my theaters. At the moment my guess would be that it gets high single digits opening weekend(April 26).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.62M Combined SizeAdjustedComp+GrowthModelForecast. $0.60M Thursday comp. $0.56M Santikos Thursday comp | I'll go with 650k Thursday based on yesterday's growth.  Gotta go with the growth model on this one with 600k (May 2). I think the pace chart says it all for this one.  Pretty tarotble (April 30).)

- Relevation ($0.58M Thursday comp. Sold very poorly as all horror seems to do in my market, and tied with The Book of Clarence for second worst seller on record. Thankfully tho my comps have been fairly predictable here, so $500-600K THU and a $6-7M OW sounds reasonable (May 2).)

**The Fall Guy EA comp: $0.74M**

**The Fall Guy Thursday previews comp/prediction *considering katnisscinnaplex's Combined and Santikos comp separately and assuming $2M for keysersoze123*: $2.11M/$2.18M**

- abracadabra1998 ($2.27M Thursday comp and $0.82M EA comp.  In raw numbers the T-1 hour update is looking pretty good! (May 2). Pretty good day, for both the EA and Thursday previews. I would probably put the EA at around $750-850k.  I will just say this is a promising update after a disappointing final week! (May 1). EA maybe around $700-800k from my numbers, Thursday continues to look anemic (April 30). I would have expected them to start climbing up by now. Again, my comps are not the best and walk-ups are king for this, but without a catalyst like a buzzy review drop I can see this have a rough final week (April 29). I'm using a variety of comps here but trying to go with the blockbusters that had better walk-ups/were less pre-sales heavy (April 25).)

- crazymoviekid ($1.47M Thursday comp and $6.48M Friday comp. Banking heavily on walk-ups, but for now $1.5M Thursday.  $6M Friday unless it acts like the under-indexed Bullet Train in my area.  At this rate $2+$6+$8+$5 =$21M OW (May 1).)

- DAJK (Fall Guy did like half of Civil War in ticket sales for EA at comparable theaters in my area (May 1).)

- el sid ($2.6M Thursday comp. Up ok 24% since yesterday. Only very slightly down from yesterday. So the jump was better than what I expected and the comparison number stayed more or less the same. Today ~30M looks achievable to me (May 2). Overall up mediocre 29% since Monday (May 1). Average (without TLC) True Friday comp: $8M which sounds quite reasonable to me but seldomly have I tracked a movie where the success depended so much on the jumps in the release week and the walk-ups. Compared to Civil War the true Friday would be only $4.7M but compared to a film with good jumps and walk-ups as TLC it's $27.5M (at the moment) (April 30). A nice number but it will very probably go down because e.g. for TLC with only 306 tickets on Monday it was way easier to have decent jumps in the next few days. The EA shows on Wednesday for sure hurt the Thursday presales of The Fall Guy so this is really no bad number. Overall no signs for a breakout hit but very, very solid. All it needs now are at least ok jumps. Not a bad number but it's a little bit as feared, it did not quite have the normal Monday jump. OTOH, other movies which already had a lot of buzz had way worse jumps, 25% are still acceptable (April 29).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27).)

- jeffthehat ($2.06M Thursday comp. Not as good of a day here. Slipped a little bit vs. comps. Thinking $2.2m +/- 0.3m true Thursday (May 1).)

- JimmyB (I know its only one theater [one of the theaters in katnisscinnaplex's Jacksonville sample] but if this forum says a movies presales are popping I like checking my local Cinemark and will see sales are doing great like the forum says.  This theater is probably the busiest theater in Jacksonville and its in a nice area of town...lots of homes, apartments, restaurants and a huge outdoor mall.  The area would be the prime demo for a movie like Fall Guy, Fall Guy sales are just DOA. 5 sales for two showtimes 5/1 early access. 5 sales for six showtimes 5/2 Thursday (April 25).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.03M Combined Thursday SizeAdjustedComp+GrowthModelForecast. $0.54M EA comp and $1.91M Thursday Comp.  $0.84M EA and $1.52M Thursday comp at Santikos | Ungentlemanly, Monkey Man and Challengers all pointing to $2M Thursday so I'll go with the recent trend!.  Pretty solid final day!  I think 2m is very likely at this point, and I'll even go up to 2.2m for my true previews prediction. Eclipsed my +60% projection and went for +68.7%! | It's only a slightly better growth than most of the comps.  Still one of the lowest in the last three days growth.  Unless walkups are insane I think 2m is a good goal for true previews (May 2). EA comps are all over the place, gut is saying like 600k for EA total (May 1). I was hoping for +30% and it only grew 11.6%... I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said.  I don't see any reason to think it grows from here (April 30). The last few days it has been on track with comps (April 29). I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 (I expect early shows to over index MTC1 big time. May be 750K for early shows. May not hit 3m even with early shows (May 1). Not much of an acceleration today. ATP is good. Still looking at low 2Ms pure thursday and around ~3m with early shows. OW could go as low as mid 20s if things dont pick up 😞 (April 30). It again accelerated (April 29). Definite sign of acceleration but overall pace is still quite low. let us see how final week goes now (April 28). Meh Pace for sure (April 27). $40M OW looks tough. Its hard to extrapolate at this point as pace is really low. If I have to guess its looking at 2.5m ish thursday only gross. So around 25-30m range (April 27). No sign yet of a big breakout. Plus early shows being just day earlier than previews will have some impact on thursday pace until really close to release (April 26).)

- Porthos ($2.94M EA+Thursday comp.   Trending in the right direction.  Finally. Now it has to be said, EA put thumb on the scale.  On the other hand, EA was kinda moribund before today, so that there were very nice walkups for it is a decent omen for tomorrow/today.  Also, RotB had an identical EA on its T-1, and this grew about .4m against the comp. Not saying 3m is in the cards.  But it might be in the conversation.  Maybe.  Likely better than the 2.5m it was looking like for a while at least. | Meh.  No real movement on comps, though is trending very slightly downwards. My bigger worry/concern is that there is very little movement on the Wed EA showings (May 1).)

- Relevation ($2.99M Thursday comp.  Average came just under $3M which sounds pretty right to me and likely means a debut in the high $20M range. $2.75-3M THU and a $25-28M OW is my prediction (May 2).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.45M Thursday comp. Fall guy is not having bad walkups so far (May 2). The best day so far. Very good recovery i would say. Bodes well for walkups tomorrow (May 1). It's slipping fast against comps. Kind of a yikes update (April 30). Pretty good T-4 (April 28). Fell pretty drastically against comp in the past 5ish days (April 27). Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- Tinalera (Doesnt seem to be much pre sale appetite right now in Vancouver and Calgary [CANADA] (April 23).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark final sets for this weekend - Fall Guy got ONE extra late night showing at my PLF for 2.25 screens (and 9 showings Fri/Sun and 11 Sat) - at the non-PLF, it got an extra screen to have 2 screens (8 showings Fri/Sun and 9 Sat)... So, even if walk ups are bonkers, there's just not gonna be a lot of open space to walk into...aka, Cinemark does not have faith this is breaking out wildly above its current presales-to-weekend-multiplier landing spot (aka, no $50M+ incoming, I don't think) (April 30). While final sets are not up for my Cinemarks, it is telling that Fall Guy is NOT getting all PLF at my PLF theater.  Instead, the Star Wars re-release is getting 1 full XD (and 2 screens for presales), which is the same as Fall Guy.  At my other local, Star Wars is not yet booked, and Fall Guy is still sitting at 1 screen for presales (April 23).)

- vafrow ($1.6M Thursday only comp.  Dipping back down a bit on the final day on comps isn't the greatest sign. While the EAs had good walk ups, and I expect similar today, it doesn't feel like there's a lot of room for this to overperform. It's behind both Challengers and Civil War for Thursday sales by a hefty margin. When you roll in EA, I'm guessing we're looking at Thursday numbers of $2.5M or so (May 2). Looking at Fall Guy EA walk ups and they're looking pretty good. It's usually hard for me to measure walk ups as data disappears once shows are 15 minutes in, but this feels like a positive sign. It's also a gorgeous day, probably the first great patio day of the season (in the Greater Toronto Area) (May 1). While I'm not reporting it still, I do still have the comps with EA rolled in, which is giving an average of $3.6M. While we won't know for a while if those EA shows will help spread word of mouth on this, it feels like it's only served to split the preview audiences between Wednesday and Thursday, and as a result, there won't be as many packed houses for this (May 1). A good day, although it's more about the law of small numbers. 66% growth is nice, but not that impressive when your baseline is so small | Another ho hum day at a point where even walk up friendly films start seeing some movement (April 29). This film is performing bad, and this market seems worse than others (April 28). Slight bump in sales, but still far off the pace (April 27). Three days of zero sales (April 26). Continues to be unimpressive. I haven't added it as a comp, but it's Thursday preview sales are actually behind Monkey Man at this point (April 24). Full showtimes are up for the Thursday previews for Fall Guy, and across my five screen sample, it only added two showings. Theyre really maintaining a light touch on this one. It's not like there's a lot in theatres right now that warrants holding onto screens either. Still crawling along slowly (April 23). A little bit of movement coming out of the weekend (April 22). I eyeballed some other showings in the area that seem to be doing better, so some of my results might be impacted by distortions from a smaller sample (April 21). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point (April 19).)

**Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace Re-Release Friday opening day comps/predictions *assuming $3.5M for Charlie Jatinder and considering katnisscinnaplex's Friday and Santikos comp separately*: $3.61M/$3.42M**

- charlie Jatinder ($4.95M Friday comp (compared to Avatar and Titanic re-release). MINI-TC2 $22k Friday sales and $44k Saturday sales. Surprised by SAT being so ahead in sales. Depending on how wide the release is, can see $3M+ FRI, may be even $4M (April 29).)

- filmlover (Saturday (May the 4th) is looking to a huge day for it just from glancing at ticket sales. As expected, of course (April 29).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27). Phantom Menace should have a good chance at #2 next Friday unless it’s in less than 2.5k theaters (April 26).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.12M Friday opening day comp.  $2.99M Santikos Friday comp | Thinking around 3m for Friday. Slipping a bit as the early fan rush will account for a large portion of final sales.  Saturday will be key with SW day (May 2). Looking pretty solid for this weekend! Comparing OD to previews will skew things a little, but not many options here (April 29). This is the largest re-release (22,369 screenings and 1,860 theaters) I've seen since I've been tracking (April 26).)

- Porthos (Century Arden and Cinemark Roseville have 184/271/78 and 126/256/50 FRI/SAT/SUN ticket presales.  Now this is only a couple of theaters, so the pattern might not be universal. Might be ""just a pun"", but, well SW fans have really adopted May 4th as a Celebrate All Things Star Wars holiday (May 2).)

- Relevation ($3.37M Friday comp.  Could easily fall below $3M or swing close to $5M but since my anime comps were skewing weirdly low (hence why I didn’t add Spy x Family), I’m gonna err higher and say $3.5-4M THU and a $13-18M weekend (May 2). It’s selling phenomenally in one of my friend’s markets for FRI, even outstripping Dune previews at the same point and it’s already well clear of Challengers, Argylle, and The Beekeeper’s entire runs at my market. Could be looking at a double digit debut (April 25).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.88M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.08M EA+Thursday comp. This has been doing pretty consistently well (April 25). Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($4.68M EA+Thursday comp. Added Godzilla which brought the average way up (May 1).)

- keysersoze123 (Its going to open bigger than Fall Guy for sure. Not sure how wide the early shows are. But a EA gross around 1.5m could be in play. Previews we have to wait and see how it accelerates close to release (April 27). Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing close to a $90M opening weekend (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.06M Thursday comp. Not even going to update Planet of the Apes because its growth has been pitiful (April 30).)

- Vafrow ($3.0M Thursday comp.  It is trending in the right direction right now (May 1). It actually had a decent day (April 29). Sales dropped by 3. Cancelled tickets for one of the shows it seems. It keeps getting worse (April 28). Continues to be sluggish (April 26). Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**IF Thursday comp: $2.07M**

- PROMOTIONS (APRIL 29 ONLY: Each purchased ticket with RegalMovies gifts a ticket to someone at 826. Regal offering 2500 rewards points.)

- abracadabra1998 ($1.31M Thursday comp. Comps are obviously silly at this stage, just wanted to show that unsurprisingly not really a lot of interest from a get-go. We shall see how it does in these coming weeks (April 29).)

- AniNate(I did see a surprising amount of single sales looking at IF charts (May 1). Gonna try some amateur local tracking: 55 tickets sold across 4 Cinemarks.  I feel like this level of unadulterated upfront interest is pretty notable for an original family movie (April 30).)

- charlie Jatinder (Hmm. So no real Regal impact it seems at katnisscinnaplex's theaters (April 30).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.61M Thursday comp. 25 Regal sales (out of 45?) (April 30).)

-  TheFlatLannister ($3.28M Thursday comp. This is very good considering the lower amount of showings it has (April 30).)

- vafrow (For a 100 km radius (which captures the whole broader region, probably about an 8M population base), it's sold 11 tickets. Still no sales locally (April 30). I think this only went up overnight, so it's not too odd to have zero sales (April 29).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.07M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.42M EA comp and $1.12M Thursday comp.  Seems like it'll be like Trolls where EA syphons off all the early sales. Very low sales will lead to big variance in these early days. Trolls ($1.63M) is the most useful Thursday comp due to similar EA situations (April 25).)

- el sid (The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.59M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales (April 28). Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- katnisscinnaplex (Just for kicks I took a look at the LotR re-releases scheduled for June.  They're getting one show each (for the most part) in around 1k theaters. Some locations already adding a second showing (April 30). Looks to be in around 1k theaters.   Sales looking good already as expected (I already got mine!) (April 26).)

A proposal to get rid of Tweet Roundups,"Welcome, and thank you for your time this morning! Today's talk is entitled ""**Social Media Roundups and Their Attendant Threads are Completely Useless**"" and today I'd like to make an argument as to why the practice should be considered for what it is: an exercise in empty regurgitation of platitudinous nothings, with no measurable benefit in helping predict a film's upcoming box-office reception - and as such, the practice should be officially ceased! 

1) **Nobody knows who any of these people actually are** -  Most tweet roundups are a collection of always-online blurb merchants who have a follower count in the low 4 digits (meaning about only 300-500 people actively pay attention to them) and whose opinions are simply bad impersonations of what they think a film critic is supposed to sound like. **Nobody knows them, nobody follows them, nobody considers them any sort of real barometer for audience engagement or anticipation, their thoughts carry zero weight in predicting box-office, and tend to go completely unremembered within an hour of their being uttered.** Collecting 10 of these opinions and sharing them in bulk doesn't lend that void of insight any legitimacy.

2) **Their tweeted blurbs are grossly devoid of content** - The blurbs being shared are always so breathlessly verbose, so naked in trying to fulfill their true purpose (being rounded up and shared by a legitimate entertainment outlet, thus validating their social media hustle for 3 minutes before being forgotten completely once again) that the blurbs might as well be AI generated by a film's marketing team. Even in the case of ""negative"" social media reactions, the negativity is mitigated by this barrage of flowery gabble, to the point that it's still impossible to tell how a normal person might react to the film they've just seen (on the studio's dime). The soup of syllables follows a recipe *designed* not to give any sort of real impression of a movie's effect, but to get rounded up by a writer at a legitimate outlet who is filling their post quota by scraping twitter that day.

3) **The Social Media Embargo is a completely studio-invented, free PR campaign stop, and always has been** - it's framed as an offshoot/evolution of the standard press cycle, but is a complete invention by marketing teams instructed to fold amateur ""journalists"" and bloggers into their pre-release plans. Much like the ""trailer views"" metric was a publicity invention - the numbers themselves were collected and pre-spun as an achievement in audience engagement *by* studio publicity firms and then emailed to legitimate entertainment outlets as free content for posting on a slow day - the Social Media Embargo was invented *specifically* to confuse actual critical reception and consensus. **It's intended to dilute real critical reactions by leveraging a lack of media literacy on social media to trick people into believing the artificial opinions being shared by Fandom Cheerleaders who just want to be noticed for having imitated a TV Guide blurb successfully, are** ***actual*** **opinions.** 

4) **Twitter is a Dead Platform, and was garbage even when it was alive** - The biggest problem with using tweet roundups as any sort of predictor of box-office is that the **people on twitter aren't representative of anything but the small percentage of people who treat twitter as a job** (freelance or otherwise). 99% of the general audience is not there, does not care, and is not swayed by what they saw or heard on twitter, and the 1% that is on twitter is *also* not swayed because the whole point of being on twitter for them is to be noticed *for* being on twitter. Almost nobody who goes to a movie, or talks about wanting to go to a movie, has ever pointed to tweet roundups/social media reactions as being even *a* factor, much less *the* factor. The opening weekend of a movie is completely divorced from anything that might happen once the social media embargo is lifted, and that's mostly because nobody that isn't a blogger, or someone paid by a legit outlet to scrape bloggers for their own content, cares about what's on twitter, or what twitter has to say about anything.

To sum up: **Social Media reactions aren't a good predictor of box-office, they never have been**. Their primary purpose is to provide marketing teams anonymous blurbs to use in :30 spots and :15 prerolls, and to give extremely-online would-be ""media personalities"" validation for being used as marketing. **The general audience does not pay attention to them, and their opening weekend turnout has nothing to do with what the social media roundups said or did.** 

Please kindly consider eliminating this part of the pre-release routine going forward. Thank you! ",6,52

Sure, there's no lack of bad takes here, but i was just wondering if im missing something. 

1. The first two movies didn't do more than 800 million each.

2. There is a LOT less interest in superhero movies now than 2016-2018. 

3. None of the wolverine movies have been huge (although several of them successful ofc), and Hugh Jackman doesn't seem like a surefire way to get a boxoffice success either. 

4. There's no story to conclued a trilogy, no loose ends or cliffhangers that needs to be adressed. 

5. Its mostly a parody of superhero movies and comics, and parodies dont do well if they dont parody something popular.

6. Its the third movie that by all means looks to do exactly the same as the other two movies. No novelty to push numbers. 

Now i dont think the movie will do poorly, or bomb or anything. I think it looks as good as the previous 2 movies, and probably will do the exact same thing. But i dont see any good reasons for it to do WAY better than the previous movies. 

What am i missing?",513,546

The average age of the main characters for both films is like 50 and the audience has been the same for over 20 years. 

I know the quality is also a problem, but they’re lacking the online discourse and furor that other blockbusters like Dune 2 and Barbie had. 

Both franchises also feature the same characters over and over again. They introduce characters on the younger side like Scott Eastwood in f&amp;f and Rebecca Ferguson in MI only to kill them off or write them out. 

And I’m not saying we should replace Tom cruise with some younger actor, they need some fresh blood that accompanies the main cast.

I have a few built in thoughts on how the moviegoing audience’s tastes have vastly changed.



1: DISNEY AS A BRAND DOES NOT GET PEOPLE IN SEATS ANYMORE 

If anyone has had it particularly bad post pandemic it’s Disney. 2023 especially has been a disaster with on one movie breaking even (GOTG 3). This is in sharp contrast to years like 2018 and 2019 where it seems every thing with a Disney logo was making a billion dollars. Now post pandemic and especially post Disney plus audiences don’t feel the rush to watch a Disney product in theaters like they used to. And I can see that taking a big effect this year as well.


2: LONG RUNNING FRANCHISES AREN’T EXCITING PEOPLE ANYMORE 

As audiences tastes have eventually changed we see that franchises that are long running entering another installment are not living up to the box office expectations of the previous entries. Take Dial of Destiny and Dead Reckoning. Both coming from huge global franchises flopped in their most recent release.


3: VIDEO GAMES ARE THE NEW HOT TICKET

Used to be the laughing stock in Hollywood has potentially become its savior. Recent hits like The Sonic Movies FNAF and especially Mario are showcasing that there is a massive audience for proper video game adaptations.

4: GOOD WOM MIGHT NOT ALWAYS EFFECT YOUR FIRST FILM BUT IT CAN BLOW UP ITS SEQUEL

The most noticeable example for this is Spider-Verse and Dune. Two movies that did mostly alright when their first installments released. But grew an audience that when the time came for its sequel it exploded massively over its predecessor.


Curious to know what other recent trends you are starting to notice and how you think it will effect the box office as a whole

There have been several non-white men who were box office draws (Denzel Washington, Will Smith, Jackie Chan, Dwayne Johnson, Jason Mamoa etc) but had there been any Black, Asian, Latina (I'm talking on the browner side, Cameron Diaz is Latina), MENA or Indigenous woman who was a major box office draw in the states and the west at large? I'm talking someone on par with Leo or Cruise but a WOC. I think the closest I can think of is maybe Queen Latifah because she was putting up good numbers for a while but I don't know if she was ever on the level of say The Rock or Will Smith or even Denzel. Perhaps there's one in the UK or France or something I don't know about. 

Can y'all think of anyone?

EDIT: I'm not just referring to women who became famous or A-List, whoever you define that. Did she have a period in which films were on largely her name alone or as a major co-lead and did those movies make more than 100m and turn a profit in the process? That's what I'm looking at here. ",92,0

**Pre-Sales map for tomorrow**

A pretty distinct three-way split for tomorrow's pre-sales.

https://i.imgur.com/zXFWS2i.png

---

###**Spy X Family:**

Spy X Family punches in a strong 2nd day making good use of the start of the Holidays grossing almost $8M and taking its total to $12.79M which is already way past what the movie has done in the US so far.

Projected total through Sunday remains on track for $33M+

Total projections nearing $50M on the high end.

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.4   , Taopiaopiao: 9.6     , Douban:  7.9

Friday|52748|$398k|$5.40M-$5.79M

---

###**Howls Moving Castle:**

Howls Moving Castle on the other hand not quite as strong. Grossing a solid $4.47M which is under projections. 

Projected total through Sunday now looking at $15M+

Total projections downgraded to around $25M. 

**Audience Figures:**

WoM figures: Maoyan: 9.7   , Taopiaopiao:      , Douban:  9.1

Friday|29733|$172k|$2.45M-$2.72M

---

###**Formed Police Unit**

The title card movie of the Holiday period does not dissapoint smashing its $12M projections and opening with $18.74M.

Projected total through Sunday could reach $60M+. A figure which was touted as its potential total gross just yesterday.

Total projections now reaching $100M on the high end. 

**Audience Figures:**

Friday|90366|$395k|$11.66M-$12.58M


---

###**The Last Frenzy**

The Last Frenzy also doesn't hold back beating its 7M-ish projections by quite a margin. Not unexpected i'd say. There's always room for a good comedy.

It will be pushing for $45M+ through Sunday.

Total projections on a bit of wider range here but could reach upwards of $90M+. Its gonna be interesting to follow this because just last year a Wang Yibo movie opened at the top just as this year but then faltered against a comedy movie.

Friday|61475|$194k|$9.77M-$9.78M

---


###**The Boy and the Heron**

Onto the holdovers now. The Boy and The Heron expectedly suffers droping to just 1000-ish screenings today. However its not as bad as anticipated. 

The recovery for tomorrow is okay but also nothing to write home about so passing Suzume(¥807M) remains off the cards for now.

###**Godzilla X Kong:**

Godzilla X Kong on the other hand does much better with its 1600-ish screenings. A very very respectable -49% from last week and its recovery for tommorow is looking much much better than for The Boy and The Heron.

Its gonna be playing on 10k+ screenings tomorrow and will be pushing for $1M+ which will be an increase from last week if it pans out. Total projections are now in the ¥980M range which is not far off Fast X's ¥984M.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes on May 10th, The Fall Guy on May 17th and Inside Out on June 21st.

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day on the 1st of June.

On the Japanese front with Spy X Family and Howl's Moving Castle now out Doraemon 43 is next on the list with a confirmed May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

There are rumors of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom releasing in China sometimes in May and My Next Life as a Villainess: All Routes Lead to Doom! The Movie will also release at some point.

So loads of Japanese content ariving to China in the next few months.

**Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes**

Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes pre-sales are now live.

I'm not sure what to think about this one. The last movie made over $100M but that was back in 2017 and in a really different market. Safe to say this movie won't make anywhere near that.

3rd party projections seem to think it can do at least $30M+ with some leaning closer to $40M+

Its not been the hotest start of the pre-sales thats for sure however a lot of the attention currently is drawn elsewhere with the Holidays start and there's still over a week to go for things to pick up.

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 

- Added a few movies releasing in the next month and a half.

* M:I-DR contains 0 seconds of IMAX scenes. Even if it had all the PLF screens,at the very best case scenario it would have added $50M-$75M to its worldwide gross.

**3\] It underperformed due to the Barbenheimer phenomenon**

* It made way less than M:I-Fallout in markets where the Barbenheimer phenomenon wasn't a thing like China, Korea,etc. So what's the excuse?
* Sound of Freedom which came out during the same time as M:I outgrossed it domestically. How did SoF navigate the Barbenheimer phenomenon better than M:I?

**Bottomline**- Even if MI7 i) did not have Part One in the title, ii) did not lose IMAX screens, iii) did not go up against Barbenheimer it would have STILL underperformed and not come close to M:I-Fallout's $790M worldwide gross. There was no such thing as ""Maverick Boost"". Top Gun:Maverick was a fluke.",14,0

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films. You're not forced to make predictions for all films. This predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So let's meet the one film for the week.

#**Young Woman and the Sea**

The film is directed by Joachim Rønning and written by Jeff Nathanson, based on the 2009 book of the same name by Glenn Stout. It stars Daisy Ridley, Tilda Cobham-Hervey, Stephen Graham, Kim Bodnia, Christopher Eccleston, and Glenn Fleshler. It follows Gertrude Ederle, an American competitive swimmer who became the first woman to swim across the English Channel.

#**PROS**

- Sports dramas are still an interesting genre for the general audience, and Disney has been very successful in the past for these kinds of films. Disney seems confident in its prospects, given they decided to give it a theatrical release after it received positive test screenings.

#**CONS**

- While there's interest in the sports drama genre, swimming hasn't been a successful subgenre. And most importantly, the film will only get a limited theatrical release. So if you make a prediction, take that into account.

So what are your predictions for this film?

And here's the past results.

**Sample Reviews:**

“The Fall Guy” is funny, it’s sexy, and it features the boy-toy version of “Barbie” scene-stealer Ryan Gosling — which is to say, this time around, he embodies the ultimate action figure. - Peter Debruge, Variety

The rare big studio film that feels human. - Lovia Gyarkye, Hollywood Reporter

The Fall Guy stands as a hilarious and thoughtful tribute to the stunt community, blending action with a poignant exploration of the sacrifices made by these unsung heroes. - Valerie Complex, Deadline Hollywood Daily

Very loosely based on the 1980s series, the film plays out over the course of nearly two hours without any fun, getting buried under empty gag after empty gag as it feels more like we ourselves are experiencing repeated head trauma. - Chase Hutchinson, TheWrap

With the self-referential humor, the industry jokes and the promise of a little romance, it feels like one of those movies we all complain they don’t make anymore. **3/4** \- Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press

Leitch’s movie pays tribute in multiple ways to the show and its scrappy spirit – but Gosling makes for a fabulous heir apparent. **3/4** \- Brian Truitt, USA Today

""The Fall Guy's"" final act is so convoluted that not even Gosling can keep it on the rails. When ""The Fall Guy"" falls, it falls hard. **C+** \- Adam Graham, Detroit News

It’s light, it’s airy, it’s preposterous and it is a lot of fun. **4/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

Unwieldy, with what seems to be an ending that's followed by 30 more minutes of mayhem, but it also makes it feel like it contains just about everything you'd want in a summer movie. **3/4** \- Chris Hewitt, Minneapolis Star Tribune

Fortunately, Leitch knows who he has, which is Gosling and Blunt as his romantic leads. **3/4** \- Peter Howell, Toronto Star

This is a movie that shoots first and asks questions never, its smarmy script so full of holes and its aesthetic instincts so cocky that you cannot help but feel pummelled instead of charmed. - Barry Hertz, Globe and Mail

Two hours of zingers with impeccable timing, two bona fide movie stars with palpable chemistry, several enjoyably meta send-ups of the business and, of course, plenty of crazy stunts. **4/5** \- Adrian Horton, Guardian

Individually, these plot strands might have felt spongily lightweight – but writer Drew Pearce braids them together into a bright and nostalgic sugar high, like the marshmallow cords of a flump. **4/5** \- Robbie Collin, Daily Telegraph (UK)

If the film results in stunt performers gaining a little more respect from the public, that's the ideal. If it merely reminds them how likeable Gosling is, that's good, too. **4/5** \- Clarisse Loughrey, Independent (UK)

Everything is lazy incoherence, cliché or leaden repetition. There’s a joke about a stunt dog that responds to only French commands. It’s funny at first, but then, like every paltry whiff of originality in the movie, it’s beaten to death. **2/5** \- Kevin Maher, Times (UK)

The frictionless charisma of Blunt and Gosling is what makes it tick: two stellar presences nervelessly bouncing and crashing off each other. **3/5** \- Danny Leigh, Financial Times

There’s a lot going on but it’s always done with a wicked sense of humour and commitment to entertain. It’s not the most cerebral cinema but it doesn’t have to be and The Fall Guy never pretends it’s anything but a cracking fun movie. **3.5/5** \- Wenlei Ma, The Nightly (AU)

Gosling’s performance is a reminder of how many just-okay action movies of yesteryear easily coasted on charisma. The Fall Guy is more than okay, but it would be a lot less without Gosling’s laidback warmth. - Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair

The Fall Guy feels indistinguishable from the dozens of other action films. And then Gosling and Blunt start flirting and fighting and verbally feinting with each other, and you feel like you’re floating an inch above your seat. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

Maybe the most surprising thing about The Fall Guy is how genuinely romantic it is. - Bilge Ebiri, New York Magazine/Vulture

With some incredible stunts and Gosling and Blunt on top form, this gloriously entertaining comedy is a love-letter to the unsung heroes of cinema. **4/5** \- Kelechi Ehenulo, Empire Magazine

A popcorn flick that quickly fades from the memory once the credits roll, sadly lacking the staying power of any of the action greats it references. **2/5** \- Hannah Strong, Little White Lies

A thrilling spectacle of immense proportions, The Fall Guy isn’t Leitch’s best film. That title belongs to Atomic Blonde. But it’s probably his warmest, most earnest and endearing... - Robert Daniels, Screen International

I truly had a massive grin on my face from start to finish watching The Fall Guy. It’s an extremely well-crafted action movie that’s absolutely buzzing with energy and charm for all 125 minutes of its running time. **9/10** \- Perri Nemiroff, Collider

This is popcorn filmmaking at its most cheerful and enthusiastic, driven by cheeky needle drops, rousing action, and movie stars. **B** \- Katie Rife, indieWire

...a blast of fun at the movies worthy of the biggest tub of popcorn you can find. It’s two hours of movie stars being absolute charm machines, and sometimes that’s all you really need. **B+** \- Matthew Jackson, AV Club

A fun-filled, fun-loving love letter to the undervalued stunt performance profession. It’s full-gear popcorn entertainment that only someone wholly passionate about stunt work could deliver. - Matt Donato, Inverse

Whenever its main characters are pulled apart, the movie magic, in every sense of the phrase, dissipates, leaving us with a bland, derivative action-comedy that’s never quite as funny or thrilling as it thinks it is. **2/4** \- Derek Smith, Slant Magazine

A blockbuster-to-be just like the ’90s used to make; a perfect summer movie, and a celebration of the hard work it takes to make a perfect summer movie happen. **A-** \- Liz Shannon Miller, Consequence

Overstays its welcome for a bit, but the stunts, the comedy, and the spark between the film’s dynamic leads make the movie a delectable kick-off to the popcorn pleasures of the summer-movie season. - Alonso Duralde, The Film Verdict

A romantic comedy with two love stories, one happening onscreen between the characters and one happening off-screen between the director and practical stunt work. **8/10** \- Matt Singer, ScreenCrush

This is a ridiculously fun movie, anchored by a movie star in a part that fits him perfectly and a director who really has been working toward this film for his entire career. **3.5/4** \- Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

He’s a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right?

From real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy.

Oscar® nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie—being directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)—goes missing.

While the film’s ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film’s most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody’s good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.

Inspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award® nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once).

[BoxOfficeReport Previews](http://www.boxofficereport.com/previewgrosses.html)

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Tarot Thursday comp: $0.54M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.40M Thursday comp. Still doing absolutely nothing (April 25). Now at 6 tickets sold lol (April 21). Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- el sid ($0.85-$0.90M Thursday comp. Not even that bad. The quite good sales in California help. Of course, with so uneven comps we have to take that number with a grain of salt (April 29). So not too great but also no disaster in my theaters. At the moment my guess would be that it gets high single digits opening weekend(April 26).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.49M Thursday comp and $0.38M Santikos Thursday comp. I think the pace chart says it all for this one.  Pretty tarotble (April 30).)

**The Fall Guy Thursday ONLY previews comp: $2.25M**

**The Fall Guy Thursday+EA previews comp: $2.84M**

- abracadabra1998 ($2M Thursday comp and $0.70M EA comp.  I would have expected them to start climbing up by now. Again, my comps are not the best and walk-ups are king for this, but without a catalyst like a buzzy review drop I can see this have a rough final week (April 29). I'm using a variety of comps here but trying to go with the blockbusters that had better walk-ups/were less pre-sales heavy (April 25). Bottom of the U curve this week most likely (April 15).)

- el sid ($3.45M Thursday comp. Average (without TLC) True Friday comp: $8M which sounds quite reasonable to me but seldomly have I tracked a movie where the success depended so much on the jumps in the release week and the walk-ups. Compared to Civil War the true Friday would be only $4.7M but compared to a film with good jumps and walk-ups as TLC it's $27.5M (at the moment) (April 30). A nice number but it will very probably go down because e.g. for TLC with only 306 tickets on Monday it was way easier to have decent jumps in the next few days. The EA shows on Wednesday for sure hurt the Thursday presales of The Fall Guy so this is really no bad number. Overall no signs for a breakout hit but very, very solid. All it needs now are at least ok jumps. Not a bad number but it's a little bit as feared, it did not quite have the normal Monday jump. OTOH, other movies which already had a lot of buzz had way worse jumps, 25% are still acceptable (April 29).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27).)

- JimmyB (I know its only one theater [one of the theaters in katnisscinnaplex's Jacksonville sample] but if this forum says a movies presales are popping I like checking my local Cinemark and will see sales are doing great like the forum says.  This theater is probably the busiest theater in Jacksonville and its in a nice area of town...lots of homes, apartments, restaurants and a huge outdoor mall.  The area would be the prime demo for a movie like Fall Guy, Fall Guy sales are just DOA. 5 sales for two showtimes 5/1 early access. 5 sales for six showtimes 5/2 Thursday (April 25).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.91M EA+Thursday Comp.  $1.05M EA and $1.85M Thursday comp at Santikos. I was hoping for +30% and it only grew 11.6%... I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said.  I don't see any reason to think it grows from here (April 30). The last few days it has been on track with comps (April 29). I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 (It again accelerated (April 29). Definite sign of acceleration but overall pace is still quite low. let us see how final week goes now (April 28). Meh Pace for sure (April 27). $40M OW looks tough. Its hard to extrapolate at this point as pace is really low. If I have to guess its looking at 2.5m ish thursday only gross. So around 25-30m range (April 27). No sign yet of a big breakout. Plus early shows being just day earlier than previews will have some impact on thursday pace until really close to release (April 26). Again there is almost no pace.  There is still time but unless the pace picks up dramatically, we are looking at a disappointment (April 17).)

- Porthos ($2.37M EA+Thursday comp.)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.33M Thursday comp. It's slipping fast against comps. Kind of a yikes update (April 30). Pretty good T-4 (April 28). Fell pretty drastically against comp in the past 5ish days (April 27). Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- Tinalera (Doesnt seem to be much pre sale appetite right now in Vancouver and Calgary [CANADA] (April 23).)

- TwoMisfits (Local Cinemark final sets for this weekend - Fall Guy got ONE extra late night showing at my PLF for 2.25 screens (and 9 showings Fri/Sun and 11 Sat) - at the non-PLF, it got an extra screen to have 2 screens (8 showings Fri/Sun and 9 Sat)... So, even if walk ups are bonkers, there's just not gonna be a lot of open space to walk into...aka, Cinemark does not have faith this is breaking out wildly above its current presales-to-weekend-multiplier landing spot (aka, no $50M+ incoming, I don't think) (April 30). While final sets are not up for my Cinemarks, it is telling that Fall Guy is NOT getting all PLF at my PLF theater.  Instead, the Star Wars re-release is getting 1 full XD (and 2 screens for presales), which is the same as Fall Guy.  At my other local, Star Wars is not yet booked, and Fall Guy is still sitting at 1 screen for presales (April 23).)

- vafrow ($1.6M Thursday only comp.  A good day, although it's more about the law of small numbers. 66% growth is nice, but not that impressive when your baseline is so small | Another ho hum day at a point where even walk up friendly films start seeing some movement (April 29). This film is performing bad, and this market seems worse than others (April 28). Slight bump in sales, but still far off the pace (April 27). Three days of zero sales (April 26). Continues to be unimpressive. I haven't added it as a comp, but it's Thursday preview sales are actually behind Monkey Man at this point (April 24). Full showtimes are up for the Thursday previews for Fall Guy, and across my five screen sample, it only added two showings. Theyre really maintaining a light touch on this one. It's not like there's a lot in theatres right now that warrants holding onto screens either. Still crawling along slowly (April 23). A little bit of movement coming out of the weekend (April 22). I eyeballed some other showings in the area that seem to be doing better, so some of my results might be impacted by distortions from a smaller sample (April 21). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point (April 19). A zero sales day after sales spiked a bit a few days ago. I think it lends support to the idea that the SNL appearance did it's job. But with reviews out and now a big public relations win, they're also running out of trigger events to jump sales (April 17). After some progress the day before, fairly quiet today. Zero sales for previews, slight bump on EA (April 16). Starting to see some movement. It's still pretty quiet, but it is moving. I wonder if the SNL appearance helped put some spotlight on this.  The gap in sales between EA and Thursday previews is closing at least (April 15).)

**Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace Re-Release Friday opening day comp: $4.00M**

- charlie Jatinder ($4.95M Friday comp (compared to Avatar and Titanic re-release). MINI-TC2 $22k Friday sales and $44k Saturday sales. Surprised by SAT being so ahead in sales. Depending on how wide the release is, can see $3M+ FRI, may be even $4M (April 29).)

- filmlover (Saturday (May the 4th) is looking to a huge day for it just from glancing at ticket sales. As expected, of course (April 29).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27). Phantom Menace should have a good chance at #2 next Friday unless it’s in less than 2.5k theaters (April 26).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.50M Friday opening day comp and $3.54M Santikos Friday comp.  Looking pretty solid for this weekend! Comparing OD to previews will skew things a little, but not many options here (April 29). This is the largest re-release (22,369 screenings and 1,860 theaters) I've seen since I've been tracking (April 26).)

- Relevation (It’s selling phenomenally in one of my friend’s markets for FRI, even outstripping Dune previews at the same point and it’s already well clear of Challengers, Argylle, and The Beekeeper’s entire runs at my market. Could be looking at a double digit debut (April 25).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.74M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.08M EA+Thursday comp. This has been doing pretty consistently well (April 25). Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18). 29% ahead of The Fall Guy on April 15.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($4.4M EA+Thursday comp. Comps are currently between 3.5m and 4m for previews (including EA) for the most part (April 17).)

- keysersoze123 (Its going to open bigger than Fall Guy for sure. Not sure how wide the early shows are. But a EA gross around 1.5m could be in play. Previews we have to wait and see how it accelerates close to release (April 27). Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing close to a $90M opening weekend (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.31M Thursday comp. Not even going to update Planet of the Apes because its growth has been pitiful (April 30).)

- Vafrow ($2.8M Thursday comp. It actually had a decent day (April 29). Sales dropped by 3. Cancelled tickets for one of the shows it seems. It keeps getting worse (April 28). Continues to be sluggish (April 26). Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**IF Thursday comp: $1.23M**

- PROMOTIONS (APRIL 29 ONLY: Each purchased ticket with RegalMovies gifts a ticket to someone at 826. Regal offering 2500 rewards points.)

- abracadabra1998 ($1.31M Thursday comp. Comps are obviously silly at this stage, just wanted to show that unsurprisingly not really a lot of interest from a get-go. We shall see how it does in these coming weeks (April 29).)

- AniNate(Gonna try some amateur local tracking: 55 tickets sold across 4 Cinemarks.  I feel like this level of unadulterated upfront interest is pretty notable for an original family movie (April 30).)

- charlie Jatinder (Hmm. So no real Regal impact it seems at katnisscinnaplex's theaters (April 30).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.14M Thursday comp. 25 Regal sales (out of 45?) (April 30).)

- vafrow (For a 100 km radius (which captures the whole broader region, probably about an 8M population base), it's sold 11 tickets. Still no sales locally (April 30). I think this only went up overnight, so it's not too odd to have zero sales (April 29).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.34M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.42M EA comp and $1.12M Thursday comp.  Seems like it'll be like Trolls where EA syphons off all the early sales. Very low sales will lead to big variance in these early days. Trolls ($1.63M) is the most useful Thursday comp due to similar EA situations (April 25).)

- el sid (The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.14M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales (April 28). Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- katnisscinnaplex (Just for kicks I took a look at the LotR re-releases scheduled for June.  They're getting one show each (for the most part) in around 1k theaters. Some locations already adding a second showing (April 30). Looks to be in around 1k theaters.   Sales looking good already as expected (I already got mine!) (April 26).)

Deadline did not do their Most Valuable Blockbuster Tournament for 2021. This post attempts to estimate the studio profit generated by Venom: Let There Be Carnage. I used Deadline's profit breakdowns for Venom 1 and other relevant MCU movies as comparisons. I estimate that Sony made a profit of **$169.6M** from this sequel. Down from Venom 1 ($246.9M).

- ThatWaluigiDude (Meanwhile, Planet of the Apes have passed the pre-sales from GxK with 15 days to go. Bad comp, true, because GxK really did bad on pre-sales until it was out and had a surge, but it is safe to say Planet of the Apes is off to a breakout in Brazil (April 24). I can say that the pre-sales for Planet of the Apes keep growing and are looking pretty decent for a movie still pretty far off, it is safe to say that movie already have Brazil locked on (April 16).)

Had it cost say $30M it might be considered a modest hit and would be well on the road to recouping.  

I haven't been able to find any articles discussing the budget in depth so I thought I would do some research.  

We know Zendaya was paid $10M but it's not clear if that's just for acting or acting + producing.  But that's about it.

Zendaya, Luca Guadagnino, Josh O'Connor and writer Justin Kritzkes are all repped by CAA.

Here is the [Deadline announcement article](https://deadline.com/2022/02/zendaya-josh-oconnor-mike-faist-challengers-luca-guadagnino-1234931787/) from February 2022. It seems like it was sold as a package deal and was shopped around to various interested studios.  It could could have been a competitive situation with multiple bidders and Amazon/MGM coming out on top by saying to Amy Pascal and Zendaya: we will give you a hefty producing fee and everything you want in your budget - Zendaya - you can hire your longtime assistant to play the umpire and your personal hair and makeup artists as consultants, etc.  With Zendaya getting $10M, Luca probably got a nice directing fee, as it looks like he was brought in as a gun for hire.

I watched the movie a 2nd time (I like it a lot and hope it can leg out to something credible like $80M WW) and here are other bits I think added to the budget.

\- CGI of the sweat - there are a lot of droplets of sweat throughout the movie that seem too perfect to have been photographed IRL and in the final scene, the guys seem lacquered in water

\- There are a few tracking shots with a ball on the edges of the frame that also seem CGI'd in

\- The actors have said that at times, they weren't hitting a ball with their racquet and their balls were CGI'd in

\- People have mentioned a couple of showy POV shots of the game from racquet/ball's perspective

\- Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross probably didn't come cheap, especially when they knew their score would be a crucial element of the movie

\- Though marketing expenses are separate, could publicity be part of the movie budget?  A world-wide press tour, which involves booking planes, hotels, security, and Zendaya's fashion infrastructure probably added a non-negligible amount to the movie.

\- Delaying a movie costs a studio money. From Vulture: [The Huge Hidden Cost of Holding a Blockbuster](https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/the-huge-hidden-cost-of-holding-a-movie-during-covid.html) 

&gt;Regarding No Time to Die:  
&gt;  
&gt;Worse still, MGM was accruing $1 million a month in interest charges on the money it borrowed to finance *No Time to Die* — cash the company couldn’t recoup until the movie, which cost at least $250 million to produce, arrived in multiplexes.

Any other expenses I'm missing?  The budget was likely just participant fees; sadly a lot of studio movies that are non-action, special effects, still manage to cost surprising amounts - $60M for Ticket to Paradise (2 stars), $45M for No Hard Feelings (1 star).  ",34,57

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre. 

Remember Want To See is not pre-sales. Its just an anticipation metric. A checkbox of sorts saying your interested in an upcoming movie.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering. 


- With tomorrow's massive rollout for the holidays a lot of the schedule clears. I'l fill it in with movies coming later in May and early June tomorrow.

However, people are being so unrealistic with their predictions. People are believing that Mufasa will destroy Sonic 3 or make more, others have been saying that Sonic 3 will get delayed just because the trailer for Mufasa trailer released first. Well these people are wrong, Sonic 3 is going to do great, even when Mufasa comes out, and here’s why:


1. Sonic 3 is gaining a lot of hype and anticipation building towards release. They are other factors that are drawing more interest towards this movie outside of Sonic fans, Shadow is going to be played by Keanu Reeves (best known for playing John Wick), Jim Carey reprises his role as Eggman, Crush 40 is participating in the movie’s soundtrack, the plot of Shadow’s backstory will draw lots of attention/interest. On the other hand with Mufasa, I don’t see anyone who cares for it, and the trailer received worse negative reactions than the 2019 remake of The Lion King. 
2. The current state of Disney. I get it everyone, The Lion King is a more popular brand than Sonic The Hedgehog, but people are forgetting about what’s been happening with Disney lately. A lot of their IP films have been persistently underperforming, even the live-action Little Mermaid remake from last year. I know it did decent making $500M, but it was expected to do better, and this proves that people are getting tired of this trend of making live action reimagining’s of their classic animated films. This trend will only continue to decline.
3. Nostalgic appeal to Classic Disney movies won’t work the second time around.
4. The Sonic 3 trailer was already released first, but not to the public yet. It was exclusively released at CinemaCon, and the crowds over there went crazy. The people who saw that trailer at CinemaCon have already been talking about it on social media. I think trailer will release publicly in May, probably when IF comes out, and the hype is probably going to burst even more. Paramount is being very slick and serious with the marketing for Sonic 3. 


With these factors, I don’t believe that Mufasa will scare Sonic 3 away, neither will it defeat the latter. Once marketing for Sonic 3 gets into full swing and the hype increases, Mufasa should be the one to get delayed. Not Sonic 3.",195,106

The remaining highest grossing films are Oppenheimer, Super Mario Bros., and Barbie which all had smaller production budgets (around 100 million I believe) compared to the norm from Disney, Marvel, DC, etc. so I'm sure they're coming up on the list and there are still other small budget high performers like Anyone But You that may show up.

The idea of high risk, high reward with major budget movies make sense to me, but if the profits of the best performing 200m budgeted film being comparable to multiple mid budget movies it seems like the better investment would be to diversify multiple 20-50 million dollar movies.

Merchandise is key too for big budget movies, but FNAF, Barbie, and Super Mario already have that avenue covered as well.

Deadline started their Most Valuable Blockbuster Tournament showing profit breakdowns in 2014 for the most profitable movies of 2013. This post attempts to estimate the studio profit for Marvel's The Avengers (2012). I used the Deadline profit breakdowns for Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron as comparisons. There is a fee I included based on revenues that Disney agreed to pay Paramount in exchange for the right to distribute and market both Avengers 1 and Iron Man 3. I estimate that Avengers 1 had a profit of **$546.3M** for Disney. That makes it more profitable than Infinity War ($500M) and the third most profitable MCU movie ever after Endgame ($890M) and Spider-Man: No Way Home. Next up will be my profit breakdown for Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dark Knight Rises.

**Theater 1 (T-7 Days):**

*Star Wars: Episode 1 - 81*

Dune 2 - 80

Bob Marley: One Love - 67

Godzilla X Kong - 43

The Chosen - 35

Madame Web - 26


**Theater 2: (T-7 Days):**

*Star Wars: Episode 1 - 43*

The Chosen - 27

Dune - 25

Godzilla X Kong - 21

Bob Marley: One Love - 19

Granted, there are a few factors, like of course a rerelease is going to be frontloaded in presales, and technically it’s an opening day number being compared to preview showings. Regardless, in a world where rereleases only make a few million, it seems something to note.

I looked on Box Office Theorey, and only found three posts about it:

**emoviefan** - *“It's going to be number 1 for the weekend. Only kidding I think. But if the Fall Guy does not pick it up in the final week  it might be closer than anybody would have thought.”*

**Flip** - *“I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets.”*

**katnisscinnaplex -**

Phantom Menace (OD) T-4 adjusted comps
 - Ghostbusters Afterlife (Total) - .915x (3.58m)
 - Ghostbusters: FE - 1.094x (3.95m)
 - Transformers 6 (Total) - .489x (3.45m)
 - F9 - .592x (3.65m)
 - Morbius - .748x (3.58m)
 - Indiana Jones - .586x (3.46m)
 
*“Comparing OD to previews will skew things a little, but not many options here.”*

There’s not a lot of data, but it seems promising. I think beating Avatar’s $10.5M opening from its rerelease is a lock, but I think there’s potential to go a lot further with these numbers, even with the known detracting factors.

It begs the question of how well one would do and if it would be able to surpass the likes of “Halloween” (2018), “IT” (2017), or the two recent “Scream” films.

I could see a new “Elm Street” film surpassing both “Scream” (2022) and “Scream VI” at the box office and finishing somewhere close to 2018’s ""Halloween,” which ended up doing $259.9M. I don’t remotely see it doing “IT” numbers considering $704.2M is a *very* rare achievement for a horror film, but I don’t think a modern “Elm Street” movie surpassing $200M is necessarily far fetched. Freddy is as much a beloved horror icon as Michael is, if not more, and I definitely can see a new “Elm Street” film becoming a smash hit if it’s good.

If Jason Blum does get his hands on the rights, I hope to god he doesn’t hire David Gordon Green, but after seeing the way “The Exorcist: Believer” performed, I’m not too worried about that. ",41,11

And so a weak April ends with a whimper.

&amp;#x200B;

With very little competition, MGM's ***Challengers*** topped the box office, yet the numbers fell far short from what its budget and marketing were hoping for. ***Unsung Hero*** had a solid start, while ***Boy Kills World*** flopped. The weekend also saw the re-release of ***Alien*** and ***The Mummy***, both celebrating their 45th anniversary and 25th anniversary respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

The Top 10 earned a combined $56 million this weekend. That represents a rough 36.2% drop from last year, when ***The Super Mario Bros. Movie*** was on its fourth weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

Debuting in 3,477 theaters, MGM's ***Challengers*** debuted with $15 million. That's the biggest debut for any film starring Luca Guadagnino, although it was a very low bar; he never had a single weekend above $3 million. The debut would be solid, if it wasn't for its $55 million budget and extensive marketing campaign.

&amp;#x200B;

It's tough to ask for a better debut here; tennis is not a popular genre and it's tough to find comparisons. ***Match Point*** may be the highest grossing tennis-related at $85 million worldwide, but it's not really a tennis film. The only ones that could be part of the genre would be ***Wimbledon*** ($41.6 million) and ***King Richard*** ($39.4 million). So even tough there are some sports drama films that gained traction in the past years, tennis was never something that could find an audience in theaters.

&amp;#x200B;

Amazon MGM operates quite different from other studios. But even in that case, it's unlikely they weren't expecting the film to open higher. After all, they gave this a sizeable budget and an extensive marketing campaign. They relied solely on their star, Zendaya. Which brings up the following point.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this number mean that Zendaya is a box office draw or not? Well, yes but also no. Deadline reported that 55% of the audience watched the film because Zendaya starred, so if she wasn't the lead, the film wouldn't get this high.  At the same time, however, it means that her name can carry a film to this level. While she built a reputation with ***Spider-Man***, ***Dune*** and ***Euphoria***, this was her first test as a movie star. And the results were simply underwhelming at best. 

&amp;#x200B;

According to MGM, 58% of the audience was female and a massive 76% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a ""B+"" on CinemaScore, which is fine for this kind of film. The big question, now, is how it will hold up. The summer season is upon us and the film might get lost in the shuffle, or it could serve as some counter-programming. Perhaps Amazon expects this film to blow up in Prime Video just like ***Saltburn***, although it doesn't make this debut any better.

&amp;#x200B;

In second place, Lionsgate's ***Unsung Hero*** debuted with $7.7 million in 2,832 theaters. This is a solid start, as the film already matched its $6 million budget. The film could also hold extremely well in the coming weeks, as it received a rare ""A+"" on CinemaScore.

&amp;#x200B;

***Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire*** stayed in the Top 3, easing just 25% and adding $7.2 million this weekend. That takes its domestic total to $181.7 million.

&amp;#x200B;

After leading the box office for two weekends, A24's ***Civil War*** fell to fourth place, although it still eased just 38% and added $7 million. With $56.1 million in the bank, it's already A24's second highest grossing film ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Universal's ***Abigail*** dropped 49% and earned $5.2 million. That's a solid drop for a horror title, although its small debut helped it. Through ten days, it has made $18.7 million.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare*** dropped 57% and grossed $3.8 million. That's quite rough, especially considering its solid reception and weak debut. Through ten days, the film has earned a meager $15.4 million.

&amp;#x200B;

With no animated competition, ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** continued holding well. It eased 23% and added $3.5 million. That takes its domestic total at $185 million.

&amp;#x200B;

***Ghostbusters: Afterlife*** recovered after its initial poor drops. It eased 27% and added $3.2 million, taking its domestic total to $107.9 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Nine weeks in, ***Dune: Part Two*** is still in the Top 10. It dropped a light 31% and made $2 million. Its domestic total stands at $279.8 million. 

&amp;#x200B;

We had another newcomer this week, and it wound up in tenth place. That was Lionsgate's ***Boy Kills World***, and we can't blame you if you didn't hear of it, as the film flopped with just $1.6 million in 1,993 theaters. With a poor ""B–"" on CinemaScore, expect this to fade out quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Disney and 20th Century Studios re-released ***Alien*** in 1,750 theaters for its 45th anniversary. It earned $1.5 million, which takes its lifetime gross to $83 million.

&amp;#x200B;

Universal also re-released ***The Mummy*** for its 25th anniversary. It made $1 million in 1,236 theaters, which takes its lifetime gross to $156.5 million.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Godzilla x Kong*** added $14 million this weekend, taking its worldwide total to $521 million worldwide. It debuted in Japan, although the film was #2 behind \*\*\*Detective Conan: The Million-Dollar Pentagram\*\*\*. The Top 5 markets to date: China ($125.9M), Mexico ($32.1M), UK ($16.9M), India ($14.6M) and Australia ($11.7M).

&amp;#x200B;

With $11.7 million this weekend, ***Kung Fu Panda 4*** crossed the $500 million milestone worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

Another milestone was ***Dune: Part Two***, which finally crossed $700 million worldwide.

&amp;#x200B;

If ***Challengers*** had a soft domestic start, it was even worse overseas. It debuted in 51 markets, but the film made just $9 million this weekend. With last week's early roll-out and its domestic debut, the film has amassed just $25 million. That indicates very weak or poor debuts in big markets, with the United Kingdom being its biggest market with $1.8 million. The only big market left for the film is Japan, which will get the film in June. It might be too early, but it's looking unlikely that the film recovers its budget.

&amp;#x200B;

One week ahead of its domestic start, ***The Fall Guy*** debuted in 38 markets and earned $8.7 million. It had some soft debuts across the world, although there were very few big markets. The biggest debuts were in Australia ($2.9M), Spain ($1M), Netherlands ($556K), New Zealand ($435K) and Hong Kong ($381K). We'll see how it performs next week.

&amp;#x200B;

***Civil War*** added $8.1 million this weekend, which takes its worldwide total to a pretty good $86.2 million. It should hit $100 million soon.

&amp;#x200B;

#**MOVIES THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*Bob Marley: One Love* | Feb/14 | Paramount | $28,659,004 | $96,893,170 | $176,768,526 | $70M
*Madame Web* | Feb/14 | Sony | $15,335,860 | $43,817,106 | $100,298,817 | $80M

- After a short run for April 20, ***Bob Marley: One Love*** closed its run with $176 million worldwide. While it got higher than expected in its opening days, it didn't exactly had fantastic legs and finished below $100 million domestically. Worldwide, it capped at $176 million. Enough to recover that $70 million budget? 

- And so ***Madame Web*** finished its run with an awful $43 million domestically and just $100 million worldwide. These are the lowest numbers for a comic book movie in years, which makes it even more pathetic. Sony kept the budget low (although some mentioned it cost $100+ million), but it still flopped. It could find an audience in Netflix, but that does not erase this terrible run. That's two flops in a row for Sony's Marvel Universe. ***Venom: The Last Dance*** should be fine, but ***Kraven the Hunter*** should be sweating right now.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

And the summer season will finally begin. But we're heading for a steep year-to-year drop.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest film will be Universal's ***The Fall Guy***, an adaptation of the 1980s TV series. It stars Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt, and follows a stuntman working on his ex-girlfriend's directorial debut action film, only to find himself involved in a conspiracy surrounding the film's lead actor. The trailers have sold it as an action comedy that could appeal to both men and women, and David Leitch has proved to be a very reliable director at the box office. It also has strong reviews, but the film will really need some help to recoup its $125 million budget. And as mentioned, the first weekend of May is a pivotal weekend to kick off the summer season.

&amp;#x200B;

Sony is releasing the latest horror film, ***Tarot***, which centers on a group of college friends who start dying in ways that are related to their fortunes after having their tarot cards read. It's easy to say that horror is a reliable genre at the box office, but the past months have seen very underwhelming results for the genre, with not a single one earning higher than ***Night Swim*** ($54 million). And it's unlikely ***Tarot*** becomes the film that surpasses that mark.

Do you like this approach? Is it cause of the flops MCU had lately? Or was this always supposed to be markted as a Deadpool movie because it is different than the rest of the MCU? Is the movie being kinda related to the MCU going to be like this big finale that kinda maybe resets the universe?

What are your thoughts on this? Do you think they'll do the same thing they did with the The Marvels and before it goes out they'll make a ""The new MCU movie!"" type of a montage (even if it's comedic/meta/satire with Deadpool announcing it or whatever) or will they try to stay clear of it on purpose?

#**Release Schedule:**

A table including upcoming movies in the next month alongside trailers linked in the name of the movie, Want To See data from both Maoyan and Taopiaopiao alongside the Gender split and genre.

Not all movies are included since a lot are just too small to be worth covering.

boxoffice,t3_1cg44k1,1714409750.0,/r/boxoffice/comments/1cg44k1/the_trap_trailer_already_has_16m_views_in_less/,,:worldwide: Worldwide,The 'Trap' trailer already has 16M views in less than two weeks. Does that seem indicative of a breakout?,"So I understand trailer views are far from the only metric that matters and that they need to be taken with a *heavy* grain of salt, but that being said, I can't help but feel like that level of attention to a totally original, non-IP title without any major stars attached is a pretty impressive feat. Compared to other blockbusters from this year, *Beetlejuice Beetlejuice* has amassed roughly the same amount of views in a month, *Twisters* has 19M from two months ago, and even *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* has less at 12M views in a week. 

The concept here is just so catchy and intriguing that I think it has serious breakout potential written all over it, especially considering what the competition is. *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* is the last serious blockbuster before it comes out, but even that will have two full weeks to itself to burn through its fanboy-heavy audience. The only other films opening the same weekend are *The Fire Inside* (an inspirational sports drama), *It Ends With Us* based on the Colleen Hoover novel, and *Borderlands*, which I personally think looks like a dumpster fire. For GA appeal, however, none of these seem like they would be seriously providing any legitimate competition. I would personally be willing to bet this opens with at least $30M and approaches the century mark domestic - internationally I'm not sure, but the setting being as general as a concert does seem like it would have strong pull overseas.

And where will its release date change to?,"There is no way they both open on December 20. One will have to be pushed into 2025. I believe it will be Sonic the Hedgehog 3, because it is possible that Mufasa will have more hype in the general audience. Sonic is more popular on Reddit than in the public. 

It is possible Mufasa will underperform, but the marketing beginning sooner will increase early awareness which could decide which studio will budge. Disney already seems committed to December because of the trailer. 

If either gets delayed, these are the days I think they would move to:

- Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (May 23, 2025 - replacing Mission: Impossible 8. MI8 moves to June 20, 2025)

- Mufasa: The Lion King (July 25, 2025, replacing The Fantastic Four. F4 moves to November 7, 2025 and Blade to February 13, 2026)

- Inside Out 2 has potential. People forget how big the first movie was. It opened to $91M and finished with $356M domestically in 2015, even with competition from Jurassic World and Minions. With how strong Pixar sequels have been in June, I think $100M+ will happen here.

- Despicable Me 4 will probably miss the mark, but only because it opens on a Wednesday. A good comp might be Despicable Me 2, which also opened on July 3 when it was a Wednesday. In 2013 that made $83M over the Fri-Sun but $143M over the 5-day.

- Deadpool &amp; Wolverine has a lot of hype online, and the first two Deadpools opened to over $125M each. The R-rating and superhero fatigue may hold it back,  but it’s more likely than not.

I'm just curious to see the reasoning. I really want it to succeed, but I personally feel like the cards are just stacked against it. A lot has changed in the last 25 years, and I can't see it doing well.

First of all, legacy sequels that don't have the original main cast rarely do well. Protagonists Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix both died in the last movie, and the only returning actors are Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi, who were much smaller characters and are not exactly box office draws. The main actor is Paul Mescal, a fairly obscure character actor. Denzel Washington is definitely an icon, but he's not known for this kind of movie, so I doubt he'll be bringing in the usual Denzel fans.

Also, ALL THREE of Ridley Scott's recent historical epics have been flops: Napoleon, the Last Duel, and Exodus. And the entire genre of the mythical historical epic is kind of dead these days.

I will definitely be wrong but I love doing this every year, so here goes.

1. Despicable Me 4
I tried looking for a potential break-out movie like Barbie or Top Gun, but the only movie I could find that really fits that mold would be Twisters, and I just don’t see it. So i’m going to play it safe. It’s no secret that this franchise has been a consistent box office behemoth, and it will essentially have the entire month of July to itself as the only family movie in the market place, aside from Inside Out 2, which will be well into its theatrical run by that point. Speaking of…

2. Inside Out 2
I know that Pixar has not been on a hot streak lately, but all of their direct sequels have been big money-makers, and the first Inside Out is considered by a lot of people to be one of Pixar’s best. Unless the movie really sucks, I don’t see how this doesn’t do better than the first one. If this flops, I think that’s a good indicator that Disney has irreparably conditioned people into waiting for their animated movies to go to Disney+.

3. Deadpool and Wolverine
Every time a Marvel movie has released in the summer in the last decade or so, That movie has been at least in the top 3 of the summer. I am betting on the movie being good, but as we saw last year, audiences are not content with mediocrity, so if it ends up letting people down, this movie could be in real trouble. But for now, I have to put it at #3.

4. Bad Boys: Ride or Die
This might be my hot take in this list. I like to use my girlfriend as a litmus test for people who don’t see a ton of movies like I do (even though I usually bring her with me every time I go), and she is more excited for this movie than any other movie this summer. I think people underestimate how much casuals enjoy this franchise, and overestimate whether or not people still care about the Will Smith slap. Another movie where the box office will likely be reflective of the quality of the movie, but the last Bad Boys movie making as much as it did really makes me confident in this placement.

5. The Garfield Movie
Maybe this is a stupid choice, but bear with me. It’ll be the first animated kids movie in theaters since Kung Fu Panda, and it’s a Garfield movie. That’s really my only justification for it, I don’t think it’s going to be good but I think that the name recognition alone will sell it.

6. A Quiet Place: Day One
Spin-offs and Prequels are hard to predict, but I am betting on the goodwill of the first two movies. I think the trailer looks incredible, I think we’re at a point in this franchise where we are ready to see how it all went down, and the other movies made a ton of money. Don’t really see this one disappointing.

7. Twisters
Maybe this will do better, but it has to compete with Deadpool the following week and that has me worried for its legs. But I think that the trailer makes it look like a good time, Glen Powell is on a hot streak, I think if Hit Man does well on Netflix maybe that gives this movie a boost too. If they really push this as a Premium/IMAX screen experience, that’ll also help its box office.

8. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes
This one is tough, because once again, I think the quality is going to be the determining factor of this movie’s box office. It has to compete with the continued run of The Fall Guy, which we know has good reviews. But it’s been long enough since the last apes movies that maybe people are eager to return to this world again. I know I am.

9. The Fall Guy
One of the only movies on this list that we have reviews for already, I am curious how that’ll pan out at the box office. It stars two people that were in the two biggest movies of last year, and it looks like fun. I think it’ll do okay but not great.

10. Furiosa
I have no idea what to do with this movie. If it’s as good as Fury Road, I still don’t know if that would translate to a high box office. There are plenty of R-rated action films to choose from this summer, and maybe they waited too long to make this movie. I think it’s in danger of being left out of the top 10, which is why I have it at 10.

What are your predictions? Anything you want to add?",62,91

I’m worried that theaters will be a niche thing like record stores or Broadway theater. Is there anyway to course correct?

If a movie like Challengers can’t break through despite strong reviews and production value, what hope is there for films not of the high concept blockbuster kind? Is it possible to make movies for affordable prices and get a good return?

Monkey Man had a cheap budget yet some still consider it a disappointment.

What would it take for the general audience to get excited to go to the movie theaters again?

EDIT: Thank you to those for pointing out that the subject matter and nature of Challengers was going to be a tough sell and a niche film regardless of its quality and that its box office prospects were inevitable because of that. I should have chosen a better example. Perhaps what I meant was the type of films that aren't the usual IP fare, the ones used to do decent business with the DVD market back then that would now be considered ""streaming movies."" It's just disheartening that such films can't do well all the time in movie theaters. But perhaps studios like A24 fill that need, which is good news.",425,624

Among them, we have an original Christmas action tentpole, a sequel to the first Oscar winner of 21st century, an adaptation of one of the most popular Broadway musicals, a sequel to probably the most streamed movie ever and a virtual *Forrest Gump* reunion on the 30th anniversary of its occasion.

***RED ONE*** 

A PG-13 globe-trotting Christmas holiday action tentpole with **Dwayne Johnson** reuniting with **Jake Kasdan** of *Jumanji* fame.

Initially billed for streaming only, Amazon MGM later moved it to theatrical after they felt it deserved to be seen on the big screen.

And it features **The Rock**, who still remains a draw as we saw in hindsight with *Black Adam* and the demise of DCEU last year.

***GLADIATOR II***

**Ridley Scott** levels up with the sequel to *Gladiator*, with industry insiders quoting it as his best work since *The Martian*, with the first footage at CinemaCon recieving unanimous praise and a recent test screening at Vegas, which described the movie as Oscar-worthy.

***WICKED***

Has a shot at being the highest grossing musical of the year if all the stars align and everyone and their broom turn up to see everyone's favourite  *Green Witch* and **Ariana Grande** on the big screen.


***MOANA 2***

The second movie featuring **The Rock**, with both him and **Auliʻi Cravalho** back to voice the leads in the sequel to the movie which always remains top of the charts on streaming year after year since its inception.

***HERE***

**Robert Zemeckis** returns with his heaviest heavy-hitter in recent years, re-assembling all the talent of *Forrest Gump* from the leading acting pair of **Tom Hanks** and **Robin Wright** to himself in the director's chair and also writing the screenplay with **Eric Roth** who is also back.

*Here* which is based on a graphic novel of the same name by **Richard McGuire**, first published in 2014 charts the lives of multiple families across multiple generations, all living in the same apartment, over the course of several decades.*

Which very much sounds like the inverse of *Forrest Gump*, where instead of following the life of a single person over the decades all across America, while *Here* follows the lives of several characters over multiple timelines in a single location.

It reportedly tested very well, infact one of the highest in Sony's history, so much so, that they gave it a prime awards release spot being their primary Oscar vehicle this year.

Though **Zemeckis** has been misfiring for about twenty years now since *The Polar Express*, **Tom Hanks** still remains a draw for many Americans as he showed with *A Man Called Otto*, as it survived the Avatar avalanche when others like *Babylon* crashed and burned.

If everything goes alright, this could be the most lucrative couple of weeks for theatres and exhibition with potential holdover legs for the holidays since no other month or period of 2024 seems to be as packed with so many buzzling titles ready to set the box office on fire.

Infact, these five titles among themselves could raise upwards of **$2B+** in box office revenue in 2024 alone.",69,166

I'd first like to say thank you all for participating. In the end, I managed to get 63 lists and I'm love how many of y'all were excited to join. I'd also like to say thank you for those who were cooperative when I reached out for corrections to their list. 

With the summer box office season starting this upcoming Friday, it's time to look at what the sub predicted on average to be the 10 biggest movies this season. And given the amount of participants involved, I give it all to you as well to determine how the average will be decided.

The first way is based on placement. I've gone through each of the 10 rankings to see which movie was picked the most to be #1, #2, etc. There were cases were movies appeared to be the top in different rankings so where they were higher is where they're placed.

The other way is to simply go by which movies appeared the most on all of the lists, regardless of how high or low they were placed. In the case of a tie and two movies appeared the same number of times, whichever movie had higher placements on average wins.

I already have lists for both of the options and there were interesting absences for both lists. I'm really I'm just waiting on y'all on what will land in the graphic. I hope to have this ready by Wednesday.

Hollywood currently faces challenges with movie stars struggling to open ""original"" films solely based on their name. Jennifer Lawrence's failed miserable with No Hard Feelings flopping and is in ruts following back to back box office flops, Zendaya is flopping with Challengers, Emma Stone has taken a step back from making commercial films and Margot Robbie's mega success hinged on the iconic ""Barbie"" brand. Other actresses like Florence Pugh often rely on a lucky indie project firing for potential Oscar recognition. No actress in Hollywood can attract audiences to cinemas unless the film is based on an established IP.

Considering the lack of actresses in Korean or Chinese cinema who can attract audiences to cinemas, Alia Bhatt holds a unique position. She not only has the potential for critical acclaim but also box office pull to draw audiences to ""original"" films. She has given huge hits with films like Gangubai, Dear Zindagi and Raazi where she was the main lead. Even in India, she is the only actress with a significant box office pull while rest of the actresses are happy playing second fiddle to male movie stars. ",21,0

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Spider-Man 3 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (FWIW sales for the other two Maguire movies the next two weeks are also looking pretty strong as well (3 being impressive considering it's admittedly always been less beloved than the first two) (April 15).)

**Tarot Thursday comp: $0.71M**

- abracadabra1998 (Still doing absolutely nothing (April 25). Now at 6 tickets sold lol (April 21). Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- el sid (So not too great but also no disaster in my theaters. At the moment my guess would be that it gets high single digits opening weekend(April 26).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.71M Thursday comp)

**The Fall Guy EA+Thursday previews comp: $3.78M**

- abracadabra1998 ($4.28M EA + Thursday comp. I'm using a variety of comps here but trying to go with the blockbusters that had better walk-ups/were less pre-sales heavy (April 25). Bottom of the U curve this week most likely (April 15).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27).)

- JimmyB (I know its only one theater [one of the theaters in katnisscinnaplex's Jacksonville sample] but if this forum says a movies presales are popping I like checking my local Cinemark and will see sales are doing great like the forum says.  This theater is probably the busiest theater in Jacksonville and its in a nice area of town...lots of homes, apartments, restaurants and a huge outdoor mall.  The area would be the prime demo for a movie like Fall Guy, Fall Guy sales are just DOA. 5 sales for two showtimes 5/1 early access. 5 sales for six showtimes 5/2 Thursday (April 25).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.15M EA+Thursday Comp. I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 ($40M OW looks tough. Its hard to extrapolate at this point as pace is really low. If I have to guess its looking at 2.5m ish thursday only gross. So around 25-30m range (April 27). No sign yet of a big breakout. Plus early shows being just day earlier than previews will have some impact on thursday pace until really close to release (April 26). Again there is almost no pace.  There is still time but unless the pace picks up dramatically, we are looking at a disappointment (April 17).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.57M Thursday comp. Fell pretty drastically against comp in the past 5ish days (April 27). Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- Tinalera (Doesnt seem to be much pre sale appetite right now in Vancouver and Calgary [CANADA] (April 23).)

- TwoMisfits (While final sets are not up for my Cinemarks, it is telling that Fall Guy is NOT getting all PLF at my PLF theater.  Instead, the Star Wars re-release is getting 1 full XD (and 2 screens for presales), which is the same as Fall Guy.  At my other local, Star Wars is not yet booked, and Fall Guy is still sitting at 1 screen for presales (April 23).)

- vafrow ($1.2M Thursday only comp and $3.9M EA+Thursday comp.  Slight bump in sales, but still far off the pace (April 27). Three days of zero sales (April 26). Continues to be unimpressive. I haven't added it as a comp, but it's Thursday preview sales are actually behind Monkey Man at this point (April 24). Full showtimes are up for the Thursday previews for Fall Guy, and across my five screen sample, it only added two showings. Theyre really maintaining a light touch on this one. It's not like there's a lot in theatres right now that warrants holding onto screens either. Still crawling along slowly (April 23). A little bit of movement coming out of the weekend (April 22). I eyeballed some other showings in the area that seem to be doing better, so some of my results might be impacted by distortions from a smaller sample (April 21). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point (April 19). A zero sales day after sales spiked a bit a few days ago. I think it lends support to the idea that the SNL appearance did it's job. But with reviews out and now a big public relations win, they're also running out of trigger events to jump sales (April 17). After some progress the day before, fairly quiet today. Zero sales for previews, slight bump on EA (April 16). Starting to see some movement. It's still pretty quiet, but it is moving. I wonder if the SNL appearance helped put some spotlight on this.  The gap in sales between EA and Thursday previews is closing at least (April 15).)

**Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace Re-Release**

- katnisscinnaplex (This is the largest re-release (22,369 screenings and 1,860 theaters) I've seen since I've been tracking (April 26).)

- Flip (I looked at two (non-plf) theaters near me, and for next Friday Phantom Menace has 99 tickets sold while Fall Guy has only 68 tickets (April 27). Phantom Menace should have a good chance at #2 next Friday unless it’s in less than 2.5k theaters (April 26).)

- Relevation (It’s selling phenomenally in one of my friend’s markets for FRI, even outstripping Dune previews at the same point and it’s already well clear of Challengers, Argylle, and The Beekeeper’s entire runs at my market. Could be looking at a double digit debut (April 25).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.36M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.16M EA+Thursday comp. This has been doing pretty consistently well (April 25). Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18). 29% ahead of The Fall Guy on April 15.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.01M EA+Thursday comp. Comps are currently between 3.5m and 4m for previews (including EA) for the most part (April 17).)

- keysersoze123 (Its going to open bigger than Fall Guy for sure. Not sure how wide the early shows are. But a EA gross around 1.5m could be in play. Previews we have to wait and see how it accelerates close to release (April 27). Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing close to a $90M opening weekend (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($4.31M Thursday comp)

- Vafrow ($2.9M EA+Thursday comp. Continues to trend down (April 27). Continues to be sluggish (April 26). Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**

- ThomasNicole (Furiosa presales start on May 7 in Brazil.  Normally starts in Brazil the same day or right after US presales start, so it seems like it’ll be a relatively short cycle (April 16).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $2.17M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.33M EA comp and $0.87M Thursday comp.  Seems like it'll be like Trolls where EA syphons off all the early sales. Very low sales will lead to big variance in these early days. Trolls ($1.63M) is the most useful Thursday comp due to similar EA situations (April 25).)

- el sid (The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.14M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

**The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition Re-Releases (June 8-10)**

- katnisscinnaplex (Looks to be in around 1k theaters.   Sales looking good already as expected (I already got mine!) (April 26).)

- ThatWaluigiDude (From the sales it really does look like Challengers will be off to a good one in Brazil. Meanwhile, Planet of the Apes have passed the pre-sales from GxK with 15 days to go. Bad comp, true, because GxK really did bad on pre-sales until it was out and had a surge, but it is safe to say Planet of the Apes is off to a breakout in Brazil (April 24). I can say that the pre-sales for Planet of the Apes keep growing and are looking pretty decent for a movie still pretty far off, it is safe to say that movie already have Brazil locked on (April 16). Planet of the Apes have opened the pre-sales, first 24 hours have sold 1/3 from the first day of Dune 2. However, Apes opened pre-sales more than two weeks and a half before Dune 2 opened their's. So this is good for Apes, solid start (April 11).)

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's John Carpenter's turn.

Carpenter grew up affected and bothered by the highly religious Bible culture of the deep south, and found cinema as an escape from the racism and politics around him. He began making short horror films with an 8mm camera when his father gifted him a camera and a projector before he had even started high school. He enrolled in USC School of Cinematic Arts, but would drop out during the last semester to make his first film.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1970s, some of the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**

#**Dark Star (1974)**

*""The spaced out odyssey.""*

His directorial debut. It stars Dan O'Bannon, Brian Narelle, Cal Kuniholm and Dre Pahich, and follows the crew of the deteriorating starship Dark Star, twenty years into their mission to destroy unstable planets that might threaten future colonization of other planets.

Carpenter and O'Bannon started writing a script for USC. The film began as a 45-minute 16mm student project with a final budget of $6,000. To achieve feature film length, an additional 50 minutes were shot in 1973, with the support of Canadian distributor Jack Murphy (credited as ""Production Associate""). O'Bannon's friend, John Landis, got them in contact with producer-distributor Jack H. Harris for distribution. However, Harris demanded 30 minutes of cuts. This is something that O'Bannon and Carpenter disliked, as ""We had what would have been the world's most impressive student film and it became the world's least impressive professional film.""

The film had a very limited theatrical run, and there are no box office numbers available. Carpenter and O'Bannon were unhappy that there were empty screenings and the audience not laughing with the jokes. But it found a cult following after they got famous for their later works. At the very least, their careers were starting.

#**Assault on Precinct 13 (1976)**

*""A white-hot night of hate!""*

His second film. It stars Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Tony Burton, Martin West, and Nancy Kyes. It follows a police officer who defends a defunct precinct against a relentless criminal gang, with the help of a death row-bound convict.

Carpenter had hoped to make a Howard Hawks-style Western like *El Dorado* or *Rio Lobo*, but when the $100,000 budget prohibited it, Carpenter refashioned the basic scenario of *Rio Bravo* into a modern setting. He wrote the script in just 8 days, and it included many references to Hawks' works. He filmed the movie in just 20 days, and he referred to this film as the most fun he has ever had directing.

There are no box office numbers available, although it was reported that it had poor sales. While it received initial mixed reviews, its reputation grew and it would become one of his best films. But he needed a hit if he wanted to continue in the business.

#**Halloween (1978)**

*""The night he came home!""*

His third film. It stars Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, P. J. Soles and Nancy Loomis. The plot centers on a mental patient, Michael Myers, who was committed to a sanitarium for murdering his teenage sister on Halloween night when he was a child. Fifteen years later, having escaped and returned to his hometown, he stalks teenage babysitter Laurie Strode and her friends while under pursuit by his psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis.

After watching *Assault on Precinct 13* at the Milan Film Festival, independent film producer Irwin Yablans and financier Moustapha Akkad sought out Carpenter to direct a film for them about a psychotic killer that stalked babysitters. He agreed on the $10,000 salary under the condition that he would write, direct and compose with complete creative freedom and asked his then-girlfriend Debra Hill to co-write it with him. They wrote it in just 10 days, with Hill writing most of the dialogue for the female characters.

The low budget meant that no big stars would appear in the film. Carpenter wanted Peter Cushing to play Dr. Loomis, but his agent refused with the low salary. Christopher Lee would turn down the role, although he would later deem this as the biggest mistake of his career. Yablans then suggested Pleasence. For Laurie, Carpenter wanted Anne Lockhart, but she was busy. He decided to get Curtis, feeling that publicity would sell itself by casting the daughter of Janet Leigh from *Psycho*.

The film enjoyed a huge success in theaters. It quickly became a word-of-mouth sensation, and earned $70 million worldwide, becoming one of the most profitable horror films ever. It received acclaim, and has been named as a huge influence on the slasher genre. It would spawn a franchise, although Carpenter would not direct another installment ever again.

- **Budget:** $300,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $47,274,000. ($226.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $70,274,000.

#**The Fog (1980)**

*""Bolt your doors. Lock your windows. There's something in the fog!""*

His fourth film. It stars Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Atkins, Janet Leigh and Hal Holbrook. It tells the story of a strange, glowing fog that sweeps over a small coastal town in Northern California, bringing with it the vengeful ghosts of leprous mariners who were killed in a shipwreck there a century before.

While visiting England, Carpenter and Debra Hill witnessed an eerie fog rolling over the landscape from a distance. Carpenter decided to tie the fog to a an actual event, the wrecking of the Frolic, that took place in the 19th century near Goleta, California. However, Carpenter hated the film after watching a rough cut, and realized that he needed to reshoot more scenes in order to compete with the increasing horror market. Around one-third of the film was filmed during reshoots.

Thanks to its low budget, it was a great box office success, making $21.4 million domestically. While initial reactions were divided, its reputation grew with time.

- **Budget:** $1,100,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,448,782. ($81.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $21,448,782.

#**Escape from New York (1981)**

*""1997. New York City is now a maximum security prison. Breaking out is impossible. Breaking in is insane.""*

His fifth film. It stars Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Pleasence, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau and Harry Dean Stanton. Set in the near-future world of 1997, it follows a crime-ridden United States, which has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's sole maximum security prison. Air Force One is hijacked by anti-government insurgents who deliberately crash it into the walled borough. Ex-Special Forces and current federal prisoner Snake Plissken is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the President of the United States, after which, if successful, he will be pardoned.

Carpenter started writing the script after the Watergate scandal, inspired by *Death Wish*. No studio wanted to finance it, but the success of his previous films allowed him to finally make the project happen. The studio wanted a big star, but Carpenter was interested in Kurt Russell. Russell wanted the role to help him avoid being typecast for Disney comedies. Carpenter struggled to film New York within the film's $6 million budget, although he still had cooperation from the city in shutting down 10 blocks. Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special-effects artist, and who also served as the director of photography at some points.

Carpenter enjoyed another box office success, as the film made $25 million domestically. It also received critical acclaim, and helped elevate Russell's career.

- **Budget:** $6,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $25,244,626. ($86.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $25,244,626.

#**The Thing (1982)**

*""Man is the warmest place to hide.""*

His sixth film. Based on the novella *Who Goes There?* by John W. Campbell Jr., it stars Kurt Russell, A. Wilford Brimley, T. K. Carter, David Clennon, Keith David, Richard Dysart, Charles Hallahan, Peter Maloney, Richard Masur, Donald Moffat, Joel Polis, and Thomas G. Waites. It tells the story of a group of American researchers in Antarctica who encounter the eponymous ""Thing"", an extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates, other organisms. The group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each other and that any of them could be the Thing.

Producers David Foster Lawrence Turman approached Universal over adapting Campbell's novella. While there was an adaptation in 1951, they wanted something that would be more faithful to the source material. While the producers wanted Carpenter in 1976, Universal preferred the veteran Tobe Hooper instead. After Hooper failed to impress, and after the box office success of *Halloween*, Universal decided to hire Carpenter. This made *The Thing* his first film made under a big studio.

After Carpenter disliked the script drafts, he got Bill Lancaster to write the film. While he struggled in adapting the film, he made some changes. These included reducing the 37 characters to just 12, and choosing to open the film in the middle of the action, instead of using a flashback as in the novella. Lancaster aimed to create an ensemble piece where one person emerged as the hero, instead of having a Doc Savage-type hero from the start. Lancaster's original ending had both MacReady and Childs turn into the Thing. In the spring, the characters are rescued by helicopter, greeting their saviors with ""Hey, which way to a hot meal?"". Carpenter thought this ending was too shallow. He opted to end the film with the survivors slowly freezing to death to save humanity from infection, believing this to be the ultimate heroic act.

While the film was in pre-production, there was still no design on the effects needed for the Thing. Rob Bottin was assigned for the job, and he deduced that the creature had been all over the galaxy. This allowed it to call on different attributes as necessary, such as stomachs that transform into giant mouths and spider legs sprouting from heads. It required so much cooperation from the crew; it took 50 crew members to operate the Blair-Thing puppet. The team wanted the film shot in black-and-white, but Universal refused as they didn't want to risk losing television rights.

While Carpenter composed the scores for his films, he decided that the film needed an European musical approach. So he flew to Rome to speak with Ennio Morricone to convince him to take the job. By the time Morricone flew to Los Angeles to record the score, he had already developed a tape filled with an array of synthesizer music because he was unsure what type of score Carpenter wanted. Morricone wrote complete separate orchestral and synthesizer scores and a combined score, which he knew was Carpenter's preference. Carpenter picked a piece, closely resembling his own scores, that became the main theme used throughout the film.

1982 was a very tough time for horror, as Universal discovered that the audience's appeal for the genre declined by over 70%. But Universal was still having hope on the film, especially as they had a few successful test screenings. On top of that, the only competition was the still unrelease *E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial*, and they expected that film to appeal solely to kids. However, after one market research screening, Carpenter queried the audience on their thoughts, and one audience member asked, ""Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?"" When Carpenter responded that it was up to their imagination, the audience member responded, ""Oh, God. I hate that."" After returning from a screening of *E.T.*, the audience's silence at a trailer of *The Thing* caused Foster to remark, ""We're dead.""

And Foster's fears were right.

The film disappointed in its opening weekend with just $3.1 million, ranking #8 and behind the fourth weekend of *Poltergeist*. With a huge amount of competition that summer, it didn't have staying power at the box office, finishing with just $19 million domestically, marking a box office failure. But the bad news didn't stay there. Not only very few people watched it, but nearly everyone who watched it hated it. The film received insanely negative reviews on its release, and hostility for its cynical, anti-authoritarian tone and graphic special effects. Carpenter also saw repercussions to his career. He was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's *Firestarter*, but Universal fired him after the poor reception of *The Thing*. His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead. He also said that while he continued making films, he lost confidence.

As years passed, however, the film underwent through a re-appraisal. Once derided, the film found a second life as a huge milestone in the horror genre. It's now hailed as one of the greatest horror films ever made, as well as one of the most influential. Carpenter deemed it as his favorite film, although he lamented that it took years for the film to get the attention it deserved. He noted that his career would've been very different if the film was a success at first, although he also states he does not regret anything he made.

- **Budget:** $15,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $19,857,465. ($64.2 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $19,857,465.

#**Christine (1983)**

*""How do you kill something that can't possibly be alive?""*

His seventh film. Based on the novel by Stephen King, it stars Keith Gordon, John Stockwell, Alexandra Paul, Robert Prosky and Harry Dean Stanton. It follows the changes in the lives of Arnie Cunningham, his friends, his family, and his teenage enemies after he buys a classic red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury named Christine, a car that seems to have a mind of its own and a jealous, possessive personality, which has a bad influence on Arnie.

Carpenter was the first choice to direct the project, although he was working on two projects first. When those projects stalled, he agreed to direct. He said this was not a film he had planned on directing, saying that he directed the film as ""a job"" as opposed to a ""personal project."" This was because, after *The Thing* flopped, he needed something to maintain his career in Hollywood.

The film earned $21 million domestically, which was barely enough for the film to break even. It received a favorable response, although it didn't get the acclaim like his previous works.

- **Budget:** $10,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $21,017,849. ($65.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $21,017,849.

#**Starman (1984)**

*""He has traveled from a galaxy far beyond our own. He is 100,000 years ahead of us. He has powers we cannot comprehend. And he is about to face the one force in the universe he has yet to conquer. Love.""*

His eighth film. It stars Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen, Charles Martin Smith, and Richard Jaeckel. It tells the story of a non-corporeal alien who has come to Earth and cloned a human body in response to the invitation found on the gold phonograph record installed on the *Voyager 2* space probe.

Carpenter was eager to shed his image as a maker of exploitative thrillers and make something new in his filmography. Despite receiving positive reviews, it barely passed its budget.

- **Budget:** $24,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $28,744,356. ($86.4 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $28,744,356.

#**Big Trouble in Little China (1986)**

*""Jack Burton's is in for some serious trouble and you're in for some serious fun.""*

His ninth film. It stars Kurt Russell, Kim Cattrall, Dennis Dun and James Hong. The film tells the story of truck driver Jack Burton, who helps his friend Wang Chi rescue Wang's green-eyed fiancée from bandits in San Francisco's Chinatown. They go into the mysterious underworld beneath Chinatown, where they face an ancient sorcerer named David Lo Pan, who requires a woman with green eyes to marry him in order to be released from a centuries-old curse.

While 20th Century Fox was struggling with the film's tone and script, they decided to hire Carpenter as he could film very quick, giving him 10 weeks of pre-production. It didn't help that the film was competing against *The Golden Child*, a comedy starring Eddie Murphy with a similar theme. Carpenter made sure to accelerate filming so that the film could open months before *The Golden Child*. Carpenter envisioned the film as an inverse of traditional scenarios in action films with a Caucasian protagonist helped by a minority sidekick.

The film received very positive reviews from critics. But that didn't translate to box office success, as the film made a disastrous $11 million domestically, which was worse than any of Carpenter's films. After the commercial and critical failure of the film, Carpenter became very disillusioned with Hollywood and became an independent filmmaker.

- **Budget:** $25,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $11,100,000. ($31.6 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $11,100,000.

#**Prince of Darkness (1987)**

*""Before man walked the Earth... it slept for centuries. It is evil. It is real. It is awakening.""*

His tenth film. It stars Donald Pleasence, Victor Wong, Jameson Parker, and Lisa Blount. It follows a group of quantum physics students in Los Angeles who are asked to assist a Catholic priest in investigating an ancient cylinder of liquid discovered in a monastery, which they come to find is a sentient, liquid embodiment of the son of Satan.

The film received mixed reviews, with some feeling the film did not accomplish its goals. But it was a much needed success at the box office for Carpenter.

- **Budget:** $3,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $14,182,492. ($38.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,182,492.

#**They Live (1988)**

*""You see them on the street. You watch them on TV. You might even vote for one this fall. You think they're people just like you. You're wrong. Dead wrong.""*

His 11th film. Based on the short story *Eight O'Clock in the Morning* by Ray Nelson, it stars Roddy Piper, Keith David, and Meg Foster. The film follows an unnamed drifter who discovers through special sunglasses that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to consume, breed, and conform to the status quo via subliminal messages in mass media.

Carpenter acquired the film rights to both the comic book and short story and wrote the screenplay, using Nelson's story as a basis for the film's structure. Because the screenplay was the product of so many sources, Carpenter decided to use the pseudonym ""Frank Armitage"", an allusion to one of his favorite writers, H. P. Lovecraft. For the role of Nada, the filmmaker cast professional wrestler Roddy Piper, whom he had met at WrestleMania III earlier in 1987. For Carpenter, it was an easy choice: ""Unlike most Hollywood actors, Roddy has life written all over him.""

The film debuted at #1, although it dropped very quickly, it was still a small box office success for Carpenter. It received negative reviews for its social commentary, writing, and acting. However, its reputation grew with time, and it's now one of Carpenter's greatest films. And for having one of the best quotes in cinema history:

&gt; ""I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum.""

- **Budget:** $3,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $13,447,978. ($35.5 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $13,447,978.

#**Memoirs of an Invisible Man (1992)**

*""Women want him for his wit. The C.I.A. wants him for his body. All Nick wants is his molecules back.""*

His 12th film. Loosely based on the novel by *H.F. Saint*, it stars Chevy Chase, Daryl Hannah, Sam Neill, Michael McKean and Stephen Tobolowsky. 

Saint's novel attracted the attention of Chase, who bought the rights even though the novel wasn't finished. William Goldman was assigned to write the screenplay in the mid 1980s, by which time Ivan Reitman was attached to direct. While Reitman liked the script, Chase (who financed it as his passion project) disapproved and he decided to leave. Wanting less comedy, Chase approached Carpenter over directing the film. While Carpenter preferred being independent, he agreed to direct the film, especially after Chase vouched for him to the studio.

The film was panned by critics and was another box office dud for Carpenter. Carpenter would go on to say that the production of the film was very troubling and vigorous. While also battling studio executives, Carpenter claimed Chase and Hannah were ""the stuff of nightmares"" and ""impossible to direct"". In 2023, he said:

&gt; ""It gave me a chance to make a quasi-serious movie. But Chevy Chase, Sam Neill — who I love and had a longtime friendship with — and Warner Bros. … I worked for them, and it was pleasant. No, it wasn’t pleasant at all. I’m lying to you. It was a horror show. I really wanted to quit the business after that movie. God, I don’t want to talk about why, but let’s just say there were personalities on that film … he shall not be named who needs to be killed. No, no, no, that’s terrible. He needs to be set on fire. No, no, no. Anyway, it’s all fine. I survived it.""

Mmm, I wonder who is that ""he"" 🤔

- **Domestic gross:** $14,358,033. ($31.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,358,033.

#**In the Mouth of Madness (1994)**

*""Lived any good books lately?""*

His 13th film. It stars Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jürgen Prochnow, David Warner and Charlton Heston. It follows John Trent, an insurance investigator who visits a small town while looking into the disappearance of a successful author of horror novels, and begins to question his sanity as the lines between reality and fiction seem to blur.

The film received mixed reviews and was another bomb for Carpenter. But it has found some fans, who deemed it as an underrated piece of work.

- **Budget:** $8,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $8,924,549. ($18.8 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $8,924,549.

#**Village of the Damned (1995)**

*""Beware the children.""*

His 14th film. A remake of the 1960 film, it stars starring Christopher Reeve, Linda Kozlowski, Kirstie Alley, Michael Paré, Mark Hamill, and Meredith Salenger. The plot follows a small town's women who give birth to unfriendly alien children posing as humans.

The film was another critical and commercial dud for Carpenter. The film also marked the last theatrical performance by Reeve, before his paralysis. Carpenter described the film as a ""contractual assignment"" that he was ""really not passionate about"" and stated that it is one of his least favorite films that he's made as a director.

- **Budget:** $22,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $9,418,365. ($19.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $9,418,365.

#**Escape from L.A. (1996)**

*""Snake is back.""*

His 15th film. The sequel to *Escape from New York*, it stars Kurt Russell, Steve Buscemi, Stacy Keach, Bruce Campbell, Peter Fonda, and Pam Grier. When a terrorist brainwashes Utopia, the daughter of the President, into stealing a detonation device, Snake Plissken is assigned to find the device and the girl in Los Angeles.

A sequel was stuck in development hell for years. Unsatisfied with the drafts, Carpenter and Russell decided to write the film themselves, along with Debra Hill. Carpenter insists that Russell's persistence allowed the film to be made, since ""Snake Plissken was a character he loved and wanted to play again."" Carpenter credited that same enthusiasm with motivating Russell's work on the script, declaring ""I used his passion to do the movie to get him to write more"".

The film received mixed reviews, who deemed it as inferior to the original. While the film made as much as the original in North America and was his highest grossing film in decades, it also carried a higher budget, so it was another flop for Carpenter. Time was kind to the film, and is considered as a worthy follow-up. Carpenter himself says that he is proud of the film, and even says is better than the original. 

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $25,477,365. ($50.7 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $42,377,365.

#**Vampires (1998)**

*""Prepare for the dawn.""*

His 16th film. Based on the novel *Vampire$* by John Steakley, it stars James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, Sheryl Lee, Thomas Ian Griffith, Maximilian Schell, and Tim Guinee. It follows Jack Crow, the leader of a team of vampire hunters. After his parents were murdered by vampires, Crow was raised by the Catholic Church to become their ""master slayer"". The plot is centered on Crow's efforts to prevent a centuries-old cross from falling into the hands of Jan Valek, the first and most powerful of all vampires. 

After making *Escape from L.A.*, Carpenter considered quitting as he stopped having fun with filmmaking. However, he was fascinated by the novel and set out to adapt it. After all potential actors turned down the offer to play Crow, he offered it to James Woods. Woods was interested in doing the film because he had never been offered a horror film before and wanted to try something new. The MPAA took issue with the film's over-the-top violence, threatening to give it an NC-17 rating unless some of the gore was cut. Ultimately, about 20 seconds of footage was cut from the film.

You can guess how it all went. Surprise surprise, another flop.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $20,308,772. ($38.9 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $20,308,772.

#**Ghost of Mars (2001)**

His 17th film. It stars Natasha Henstridge, Ice Cube, Jason Statham, Pam Grier, Clea DuVall and Joanna Cassidy. Set on a colonized Mars in the 22nd century, the film follows a squad of police officers and a convicted criminal who fight against the residents of a mining colony who have been possessed by the ghosts of the planet's original inhabitants.

Broken record but you are right: another bomb. Carpenter stated he was intentionally trying to make the film as over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek as possible. He claimed he was trying to make a mindless and silly, yet highly entertaining and thrilling, action flick where ""the universe allows its characters and plot points to be silly without becoming full-fledged comedies.""

- **Budget:** $28,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $8,709,640. ($15.3 million adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $14,010,832.

#**The Ward (2010)**

*""Only sanity can keep you alive.""*

His 18th and final film. It stars Amber Heard, Mamie Gummer, Danielle Panabaker, Laura-Leigh, Lyndsy Fonseca and Jared Harris. Set in 1966, the film chronicles a young woman who is institutionalized after setting fire to a house, and who finds herself haunted by the ghost of a former inmate at the psychiatric ward.

After *Ghosts of Mars*, Carpenter simply lost interest in filmmaking. In the meantime he had done two episodes for the anthology TV show *Masters of Horror*, and he said that the series reminded him of why he fell in love with the craft in the first place. Carpenter said that the script ""came along at the right time for me"", and he was particularly fascinated by how the film took place within a single location.

The film received a very limited run in theaters before hitting digital, so it became another flop and his lowest film ever. It also received poor reviews, and some lamented that this would be his swan song. 

- **Budget:** $10,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $7,760. ($11,115 adjusted)

- **Worldwide gross:** $5,351,580.

#**Other Projects**

As mentioned, he is also a composer, having scored nearly all his films. He also scored the recent *Halloween* trilogy, even though he didn't write nor direct anything. 

Many of his films have been remade and he doesn't care in the slightest. He has said that they can do whatever they want as long as he gets paid.

&gt; “I love it, if they are going to pay me money. If they pay me, it’s wonderful. If they don’t pay me, I don’t care. I think it’s unfair if they don’t pay me. I think everyone should pay me. Why not? I’m an old guy now and I need money. Send me money.”

#**The Future**

Carpenter has not directed another film ever since. He has said multiple times that he feels burned out by the industry and he is not interested in returning to the director's chair. He said he would only return for a new film under three conditions: it needs a reasonable budget, plenty of time to prepare, and time off for the basketball season and the playoffs.

He said he is content with his current lifestyle. What's that lifestyle? In his words, ""Get up late, watch a little news, play a video game, watch some basketball, go to bed."" Ain't that the dream?

He made 18 films, but only 16 have reported box office numbers. Across those 16 films, he made $340,067,044 worldwide. That's $21,254,190 per film.

#**The Verdict**

Not reliable. Not even close.

Well, he ain't known as a cult filmmaker for nothing. Carpenter didn't get the respect and appreciation he deserved at first, so he was often struggling to find an audience in theaters. Despite so many bombs, studios continued financing him, which is a welcome surprise. At least, he got to see that his once-reviled works are now an influential and beloved part of cinema. Now, as he puts it, his career would look far more different if *The Thing* wasn't a commercial and critical dud in its initial release. We can't theorize, for we don't know this kind of what if. But Carpenter built an impressive and memorable filmography, even if his later works represented some of the worst films he made.

And look, he is content with retirement. Playing video games and watching the NBA sounds like a good deal for anyone.

It is set to release in May 22 2026. Now the question is, how much will the film make? 

Star Wars has done extremely well at the box office outside of Solo: A Star Wars Movie which underperformed and only made ~$385 m. Not much is known about the film except that Jon Favreau will direct and Pedro Pascal will return as the Din Djarin. Favreau and Disney have a great partnership with him directing the Jungle book which made $960 million and The Lion King which made over $1.6 billion at the box office. The Mandalorian has a lot of goodwill and is one of the most popular Disney+ shows, and the longest running one with 3 seasons, and Pedro Pascal only seeming to increase in popularity, as well as Grogu who is one of the most marketable characters Disney has made in recent years. Although Star Wars has been in a rough spot recently, I think audiences will come out in droves to watch this one.

My prediction: $465-490 m domestically | $520-545 million Internationally | $985 m-1.035 b Worldwide

**SYNOPSIS:**

From visionary filmmaker Luca Guadagnino, Challengers stars Zendaya as Tashi Duncan, a former tennis prodigy turned coach and a force of nature who makes no apologies for her game on and off the court. Married to a champion on a losing streak (Mike Faist – West Side Story), Tashi’s strategy for her husband’s redemption takes a surprising turn when he must face off against the washed-up Patrick (Josh O’Connor – The Crown) – his former best friend and Tashi’s former boyfriend. As their pasts and presents collide, and tensions run high, Tashi must ask herself, what will it cost to win.

I'm enthusiastic to tell y'all we have crossed the 50 entrant threshold and now have 56 people involved!

Y'all have a day to get in, afterwards I'm locking the polls. Afterwhich I will also reveal the average summer box office predictions of the sub.

For those who still want to join, I just want to say because I've had to message several about this: **DO NOT LEAVE THE BACKUP FILM BLANK**. I don't care if you don't have one off the top of your head, it's mandatory in order for everyone to be on a fair playing field and if one films gets delayed to out of the summer season and you don't have a backup, you will only have 9 films and thus have less of a chance to get points.

Also: ***Please do not list Horizon: An American Saga*** in seperate movies. Do not put Chapter One beside it. As I said earlier and in the poll, we are taking both films gross culmulatively just so we avoid any confusion.

Follow the form to join the game: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0JK2LpkuMU1W-5POg16HnISiOwZWif-z57kZRPCw5biGj9g/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0JK2LpkuMU1W-5POg16HnISiOwZWif-z57kZRPCw5biGj9g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

I've been tracking ticket sales for movies recently at my two local NJ AMCs that do fairly well.

Last week, the April counter-programming came in at full force as **Abigail** and **The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare** effectively gave audiences their alternative options.  To make matters even better, Abigail excelled passed my **$.91M Thurs** and **$2.20M Fri** predictions for actuals surpassing my **$3.11M Thurs+Fri** guesstimate.  Even The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, which was still unable to break Guy Ritchie's $10M opening barrier, had actuals came in slightly above my **$.64M Thurs** and **$2.03M Fri**.  Even with additional previews, actuals came in higher than my **$2.92M Pre+Thurs+Fri** prediction.  Still, these openings are just okay as Abigail goes up against a **$28M** budget while TMoUW has to deal with a slightly more difficult **$60M** pricetag.

In the final weekend before the official kickoff to the Summer movie season, MGM is finally set to release their long-awaited Zendaya tennis flick.  Originally set for a September 2023 debut, **Challengers** was delayed 7 months due to the ongoing duel WGA/SGA strikes.  Now, with their hot cast in full force hitting the green carpets, indie director Luca Guadagnino is hoping to have his highest outing yet.  As a young, female driven, auteur package, we will be using **Lisa Frankenstein** as a comp.   I have recorded ticket sales for this Thursday and Friday for 3 Days. The green bars are how much ticket sales increased from day to day.

https://preview.redd.it/c5im0leeqqwc1.png?width=2348&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf549d46e1038308830b570dd07257ccd8cac23

For Thursday, it is looking like Challengers is ready to serve.  Not only were ticket sales healthy to start with, but they showed a strong, yet fluctuating, day to day growth at both locations.  At this rate, Challengers is on track for a **$1.43M** slice Thursday night compared to LF. (**Things to Note:** There were **$.50M** of Monday previews that will be added in later.  With all the PLFs, Challenger numbers may see higher).  As an original, indie headed sports pic, this is a pretty healthy start.  Even for star driven drama titles like this, Challengers is showing a strong presence with theater capacities of **M: 4.22%** and **EH: 7.12%.**  With the minimal showings in addition to the desired cast, these are pretty impressive numbers signifying stronger than usual demand, especially compared to LF, which had theater capacities of **M: 1.42%** and **EH: 5.11%.**  As long as the marketing is able to grab a wider audience and the positive word of mouth continues to take hold of conversations, this is looking to be a strong start for what else would be a light weekend.

https://preview.redd.it/cqyweikdqqwc1.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9b152c6cb73cf5905472cfca0288d9a4187d3795

Continuing the good momentum, Friday is looking to rally for another healthy day.  Like Thursday, we are seeing a strong grow of sales throughout the week even though tickets were already strong to begin with.  Currently, Challengers is aiming towards a a **$4.90M** Fri compared to LF.  Once again, given the history of the director, this a superb outing and really shows the power of Zendaya.  To not much surprise, the demand is stronger than average for a title like this with theater capacities of **M: 8.72%** and **EH: 15.83%.**  It should be noted that Theater 2, which is a prime location for auteur dramas like this, is showing a strong demand, but Theater 1 is not that far behind signifying the general audience reach MGM is facing here.  Compared to LF, Challengers is keeping a healthy pace against **M: 1.42%** and **EH: 5.11%** theater capacities, showing a healthy desire from audiences.  While these are still not blockbuster numbers, Challengers is showing the true power of a young, hot star attached to a quality mid-budget feature.

Overall, this will bring Challengers to an Pre+Thur+Fri opening of **$6.83M**.  Did the 7 month delay help or hider this opening?  We may never know, but given the current marketplace for original dramas, I think Zendaya and crew should take this as a win.  If these numbers hold, we could be looking at a 3-day weekend of **$17M.**  Against a **$55M** budget, there may need to be some stronger than usual legs to make this match worth it.  Still, given the overall stellar word of mouth, potential awards buzz in the near future, and no real blockbusters in the near future, Challengers is looking to be on track for a healthy, steamy run.

I have taken some suggestions to help make this post better. Please comment if you have anymore!

Deadline has not published their Most Profitable Movie List for 2023 yet. I decided to take a stab at estimating the profits for some of the biggest movies of the year. This post is starting with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. I looked at Deadline's profit breakdowns for other relevant MCU movies such as Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. I estimate that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 had a profit of **$98M** similar to Thor: Love and Thunder ($103M). Next up is Oppenheimer.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Aliens Re-Release**

- AniNate (That Alien rerelease in two weeks looks to be selling pretty well too (April 15).)

**Boy Kills World Thursday Comp: $0.26M**

- filmlover (Has sold practically nothing near me (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.32M Thursday comp. $0.18M Thursday Santikos comp. Actually beat all the comps yesterday, and 3-day pace is right in line.  Should be in the 350k range (April 25). 0.611x of Vengeance and 0.846x of Bones and All (April 18). Ticket sales on par with Vengeance ($658k opening day) (April 16).)

- Relevation ($0.29M Thursday comp. We now have a new worst selling movie in my market after The Book of Clarence held the crown from the beginning of my tracking dataset. Overall very rough goings, but the two original non EA action comps I have say basically the same thing, sooooo $300K previews and a $3M OW? (April 24).)

- ReturnOfTheBoxOffice (Still DOA (April 23).)

**Challengers Estimated EA: $0.5M-$0.6M**

**Challengers Thursday Comp/Prediction *assuming $1.5M for TheFlatLannister*: $1.65M/$1.83M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.59M EA comp and $1.14M Thursday comp.  Good growth in the last few days, but still a ways from other markets it seems. I'm going to go with my numbers here, thinking about the good pace, and go with $1.25 Million, +/- 0.2. With around $600k in previews I could see them round up and report 2 million total previews (April 24). This movie must be underperforming here, most comps still pointing to sub-$1 million (but trending upwards). I think I'll partially blame it on arguably the heaviest pre-sale theater in town only going on sale yesterday, so that hasn't caught up to the level of other films (April 23). Still not doing great here but with an important caveat that one of the two heaviest pre-sale theaters hasn't released showtimes for Thursday previews for some reason. Whenever it does I can see the pre-sale number bounce up artificially somewhat (April 18). When you separate the EA and the Thursday numbers... not a pretty picture. Really hoping this picks up from here (April 15). This was a very strong start locally, obviously carried by the EA but a good sign of local interest (April 12).)

- crazymoviekid (Thursday comps ranging between $.75M-$1.25M and Friday comps still wide, feeling more $4.5M+ (April 24). Aiming between $1M-$1.5M Thursday comps. Kinda wide Friday comps, but feeling a good chance at $5M+ right now (April 23).)

- el sid (Average Thursday comp: (without Marry Me and No Hard Feelings): $2.2M. With the other two comps included it would look (even) better, so I stick with $2.5M. Best sales in San Francisco. Doing fine in almost all of my theaters. A bit weaker between the coasts but by far not as uneven as e.g. Monkey Man. Up nice 36% since yesterday (April 24). Positive surprise. (April 23).)

- Flip (Challengers is selling VERY good, EA shows already close to capacity and still good sales for Thursday (April 12).)

- jeffthehat ($1.82M Thursday comp. Pacing a little better than Civil War, which had one of the best paces I've tracked. MTC1 is ~57% of sales. For Civil War it was ~65% on T-2 or so. So don't think it's gonna be a big MTC1 skew like Monkey Man.  Thinking ~$2m Thu-only as well (April 24). Pace looks really good here. This is like T-1.5 relative to when I pull in the US, so average is likely overshooting today. But Civil War was pulled at same time and it's the one I'm paying most attention to (April 23).)

- JonathanMB (Checked the same theaters again, sales picked up a little bit at each of them for Thursday, but then I decided to check Friday night's showtimes and each theater has already sold 50%+ more tickets for Friday than Thursday; which is rare around here. So hopefully that means a somewhat backloaded preview-to-Friday ratio (April 24). I'm out in the western suburbs of Chicago and do unofficial checks in my area to get a vibe on how a movie is selling, and it's pretty low so far at the AMCs near me, but in Chicago itself it's selling stupid-well, with several Thursday and even Friday evening shows already 50%+ full. So it seems like there will be a bit of a divide in those markets for this (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.65M Thursday comp. $1.56M EA+Thursday comp. $1.45M Santikos Thursday comp. Looking for about +60% today that would finish at 1.7m true previews (April 25).)

- keysersoze123 (Obviously yesterday was heavily boosted due to TMobile deal. Should hit 2m thursday I feel or come very close. Add another 600-700K for early shows. Definitely feel good about 20m OW as well looking at thursday pace and great reviews seen so far (April 24). Really good day and it was expected considering TMobile deal. I am sticking to my prediction though it could over index big time at MTC1 here just like some of the other recent releases (April 23). I could not run this yesterday and so its 2 days of data and I expect the pace today would be up quite a bit from yesterday. Definitely think potential is there for 20m OW (April 21). Still the pace is not there (April 19). Strong early show sales and looking at previews/Friday, its looking at 20m OW (April 16). So far release looks small. I am not buying a big OW at this point. I double checked my locations and they had... five tickets total sold for EA.  LA looking good though and probably some of the big metros. I was looking at presales for Don't Worry Darling and it wont be easy for Challengers to be that big. Not behaving like a big breakout. I am sure anecdotally doing well in big cities (April 12).)

- Relevation ($1.56M Thursday comp. Challengers on the whole looks to be skewing a little low here. Probably a Thurs preview finish in the $1.75-2M range given mine and other trackers' data, which yields nicely for a $15-20M debut (April 24).)

- ReturnOfTheBoxOffice (Challengers is picking up a little bit today (April 23).)

- TheFlatLannister ($1.52M Thursday comp. All comps converging at $1.5M. Will probably be reported as $2M +/- $0.2M (April 25). With EA sales baked in this should do $2M+ (April 24). Heading to $1.5M+ excluding EA. Definitely picked up speed here (April 23). Nice increase today (April 19). This is pretty good. Could do $1.5M+ previews (April 18). Pretty big increase today (April 13). Has a good amount of showings but no early signs of a breakout. It's still very early though (April 12).)

- TwoMisfits ($5 tickets are live...but remember, they tend to help Friday and Saturday more than Thursday, b/c if it's $5 anytime, why not go on a weekend night (April 23). Challengers will be a $5 TMobile/Atom deal next week (starting Tuesday) - plan accordingly (April 18).)

- vafrow ($2.55M Thursday comp. Slightly ahead of Civil War (which I pulled later in the morning) and below Mean Girls (April 25).)

**Unsung Hero EA Only Comps/Predictions: $1.4M/$1M**

**Unsung Hero Thursday Only Comp/Predictions: $0.36M/$0.36M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.32M Thursday and $1.92M EA+Thursday comp. The EA completely messes up the pace and the comps here but maybe around $300-350k Thursday only, around 1 million Wednesday? My brain can't really comprehend how that's possible but the difference is astounding lmao (April 24). Over 80% of sales are Early Access (April 21).)

- el sid (So after all the annoying search, I still can't provide you with a concrete number but you see that in comparison it looks really good for that film. And what surprised me most: It's doing fine almost everywhere (despite having only 1-2 shows/theater) (April 24).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.42M combined Thursday Adjusted+Growth comp. $1.65M EA+Thursday comp.  $2.20M EA comp and $0.29M Thursday comp Santikos Tracking. This hasn't shown any growth over the past few days (+4% since Friday) (April 23).)

- Relevation ($0.39M Thursday comp.  I suppose I'll project out $400K pure THU and a $6-8M OW (April 24).)

- TwoMisfits (Free tickets were only available for the opening preview (April 25).)

**Spider-Man 3 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (FWIW sales for the other two Maguire movies the next two weeks are also looking pretty strong as well (3 being impressive considering it's admittedly always been less beloved than the first two) (April 15).)

**Tarot Thursday comp: $0.68M**

- abracadabra1998 (Now at 6 tickets sold lol (April 21). Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- el sid (Showed some small signs of life in my theaters (April 13).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.68M Thursday comp)

**The Fall Guy EA+Thursday previews comp: $3.59M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.42M EA + Thursday comp. Bottom of the U curve this week most likely (April 15).)

- JimmyB (I know its only one theater [one of the theaters in katnisscinnaplex's Jacksonville sample] but if this forum says a movies presales are popping I like checking my local Cinemark and will see sales are doing great like the forum says.  This theater is probably the busiest theater in Jacksonville and its in a nice area of town...lots of homes, apartments, restaurants and a huge outdoor mall.  The area would be the prime demo for a movie like Fall Guy, Fall Guy sales are just DOA. 5 sales for two showtimes 5/1 early access. 5 sales for six showtimes 5/2 Thursday (April 25).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.36M EA+Thursday Comp. I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 (Again there is almost no pace.  There is still time but unless the pace picks up dramatically, we are looking at a disappointment (April 17).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.98M Thursday comp. Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- Tinalera (Doesnt seem to be much pre sale appetite right now in Vancouver and Calgary [CANADA] (April 23).)

- TwoMisfits (While final sets are not up for my Cinemarks, it is telling that Fall Guy is NOT getting all PLF at my PLF theater.  Instead, the Star Wars re-release is getting 1 full XD (and 2 screens for presales), which is the same as Fall Guy.  At my other local, Star Wars is not yet booked, and Fall Guy is still sitting at 1 screen for presales (April 23).)

- vafrow ($1.1M Thursday only comp and $4.0M EA+Thursday comp.  Continues to be unimpressive. I haven't added it as a comp, but it's Thursday preview sales are actually behind Monkey Man at this point (April 24). Full showtimes are up for the Thursday previews for Fall Guy, and across my five screen sample, it only added two showings. Theyre really maintaining a light touch on this one. It's not like there's a lot in theatres right now that warrants holding onto screens either. Still crawling along slowly (April 23). A little bit of movement coming out of the weekend (April 22). I eyeballed some other showings in the area that seem to be doing better, so some of my results might be impacted by distortions from a smaller sample (April 21). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point (April 19). A zero sales day after sales spiked a bit a few days ago. I think it lends support to the idea that the SNL appearance did it's job. But with reviews out and now a big public relations win, they're also running out of trigger events to jump sales (April 17). After some progress the day before, fairly quiet today. Zero sales for previews, slight bump on EA (April 16). Starting to see some movement. It's still pretty quiet, but it is moving. I wonder if the SNL appearance helped put some spotlight on this.  The gap in sales between EA and Thursday previews is closing at least (April 15).  EA sales are outpacing the previews by quite a bit. With pretty much every theatre offering EA, I think it's just functioning as opening day (April 13).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.63M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.59M EA+Thursday comp. Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18). 29% ahead of The Fall Guy on April 15.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.01M EA+Thursday comp. Comps are currently between 3.5m and 4m for previews (including EA) for the most part (April 17).)

- keysersoze123 (Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing like what Quorum is predicting (100% of $90M opening weekend) (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($3.98M Thursday comp)

- Vafrow ($3.3M EA+Thursday comp. Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21). What's interesting that's probably been in effect for a few weeks now, is that MTC4 has increased the premium for Dolby theatres. I'm pretty sure it was $3 not that long ago. It's now $5. There's been a baseline price increase not that long ago as well. They also added a service fee for booking online tickets about a year ago that's been controversial, and being challenged by Canada's Competition Bureau as a form of drip pricing. It's been a pretty transparent way for the chain to increase revenues, but not adding it to the box office and sharing with studios. I'm not sure if the various price increases has to do with anticipation of having to drop the service fee if they lose the lawsuit. Regardless, this adds a twist to comps. Most big new releases still skew heavily to premium formats, and probably helps push up sales (April 12). Initial rush seems to be over. Not the greatest baseline, but we're still really far out (April 11).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**

- ThomasNicole (Furiosa presales start on May 7 in Brazil.  Normally starts in Brazil the same day or right after US presales start, so it seems like it’ll be a relatively short cycle (April 16).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $3.14M**

- el sid (The start in my theaters was very modest. It had today for Thursday, May 23, combined 19 sold tickets (in all of my 7 theaters) (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.14M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Maybe it's only in Sacto, but have to say I was rather impressed with Garfield's sales. Did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (Still no sales. KFP4 was at 12 for day 2 (April 24). No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

MOM had an huge 450 million opening weekend, only to have a staggering 67% drop in the second, following an divisive reception, including a B+ rating on Cinemascore.

The previous Deadpool movies had a nearly exact world wide number of around 780 million, being some of the most sucessfull R-rated movies ever. Will the Wolverine hype manage to elevate it higher to a possible billion, even with the R-rating and some recent MCU movies disappointing general audiences?",170,195

I am personally not offended by her comments, just asking for the sake of conversation. *

Melissa Barrera was fired from Scream 7 on November 2023 due to her comments on the Israel-Palestine conflict. Barrera was met by support online and from others in the industry. 

Her recent film, the horror film Abigail, grossed 10.2M in its opening weekend. This was seen as a soft debut, not even able to edge Civil War in its second weekend. It is still trailing behind Civil War in the weekday. 

Despite Barrera receiving support online, did her comments have an impact on the film’s performance? Can this lead to Barrera being unchosen from projects in the future? And will this lead to more celebrities disengaging from social issues? I’m curious to hear people’s thoughts on the matter.",51,0

What are your predictions for the Summer 2024 Box Office (First Weekend of May through Labor Day)? I'll include my predictions for everything I expect to earn over $200M worldwide. For fun, I'll include Domestic Opening Weekend and Final Domestic Total as well. If asked, I'll include rationale in the comments, because this post will be long enough already. If you're wondering why many of the numbers look weirdly specific, it's so the chances of being spot on are a bit higher. All in all, I think the box office this Summer is shaping up to be weaker than than the last two years, but who knows? Maybe something will really surprise, but my bold prediction is that this will be the first Summer (excluding 2020 and 2021) since 2009 that won't have anything cross $1 billion. It'll take a little bit to really gain momentum, and once it does, the catch up game will be impossible to play. That said, the season won't be without hits. We'll see how silly I look when the dust settles, but I'm curious to see where you stand on this Summer's predictions.

With some perfect timing, as Box Office Pro simply gave up on long range forecasts.

We're making long range predictions for films, 4 weeks out from their premieres. **You will predict the opening weekend, domestic total and worldwide gross of these films.** You're not forced to make predictions for all films. This predictions will be open for 48 hours and the results will be polled to form a consensus and posted the next week.

So without further ado, let's meet the two films for May 24-26, 2024, which is Memorial Day weekend.

#**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**

The film is co-written, produced and directed by George Miller (the *Mad Max* saga, *Happy Feet* and *Babe*), and stars Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke and Alyla Browne. Set 15-20 years before the events of *Mad Max: Fury Road*, as the world falls apart, young Furiosa is snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and into the hands of a Biker Horde led by the Warlord Dementus. While two Tyrants war for dominance over the Citadel, Furiosa survives many trials as she plots a way back home through the Wasteland.

#**The Garfield Movie**

The film is directed by Mark Dindal (*The Emperor's New Groove* and *Chicken Little*), and is based on Jim Davis' comic strip. It stars the voices of Chris Pratt, Samuel L. Jackson, Hannah Waddingham, Ving Rhames, Nicholas Hoult, Cecily Strong, Harvey Guillén, Brett Goldstein, Bowen Yang, and Snoop Dogg. After an unexpected reunion with his long-lost father, Garfield and his canine friend Odie are forced from their perfectly pampered life into joining Vic in a hilarious, high-stakes heist.

Now that you've met this week's new releases. Let's look at some pros and cons.

#**PROS**

- Even though it wasn't a big box office hit, *Mad Max: Fury Road* quickly earned a reputation as one of the greatest action films of the century, even winning six Academy Awards and having a strong run in DVD. With George Miller back, the audience will be excited for a new installment in the franchise. Not to mention that Anya Taylor-Toy and Chris Hemsworth are among this generation's most popular actors.

- *Garfield* remains one of the most iconic cartoons in history. Even the reviled live-action films were still successful at the box office. It will also be the first animated title in 2 months, so kids will be very excited for something new if they're not interested in *IF*.

#**CONS**

- As mentioned, *Mad Max: Fury Road* wasn't a huge hit upon its release due to its high budget, so it all depends if *Furiosa* has a similar or higher budget. 9 years is quite a long time for audiences to lose interest in follow-ups. Other than *Star Wars*, prequels often decrease from previous films rather than increasing. And finally, while Taylor-Joy and Hemsworth are popular actors, none are exactly box office draws; Taylor-Joy has starred in a lot of bombs in the past years, while Hemsworth hasn't had a box office success outside the MCU in over 10 years.

- While the live-action *Garfield* films were successful, they capped off at $203 millionw worldwide. Of course, perhaps with better reception it could improve. And while it will benefit from being the first animated title in 2 months, it won't wait too long for competition to come, as *Inside Out 2* is coming out just 3 weeks later, which will soon be followed by *Despicable Me 4*. Compared to those, *Garfield* may not be prioritary for families.

So what are your predictions for these films?

And here's last week's results.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes opens a bit lower but excellent WOM allows it to have great staying power over the summer ultimately making 500m WW

IF is a massive bomb grossing sub 100m WW

Furiosa does not win the weekend but it will like Apes have great staying power grossing in line with FR

Garfield wins the Memorial Day weekend and ends up doing really good business until Inside Out 2  around 460m WW

Bad Boys 4 does less than Bad Boys 3 around 350m WW

Inside Out 2 is a massive hit and ultimately saves Pixar from its box office rut. Not only that but it will also be 2024s first billion dollar picture 1.05b WW

A Quiet Place Day One makes around where the second film did 280m WW

Despicable Me 4 will become the highest grossing Despicable film grossing 1.2b WW

Twisters is the big surprise of the summer grossing over 600m WW

Deadpool and Wolverine will cross a billion but still won’t beat Jokers record 1.03b

The Horizon films do very well domestically but overseas it’s completely ignored 

Part One 220m WW
Part Two 230m WW

Combined 450m WW

Alien Romulus is a solid hit for the franchise ensuring that it still has a pulse

Borderlands is a historic bomb

The fight scenes are an area where Boy Kills World could have benefited from a bit more steadiness. But, it's fun for a one time watch. **2.5/5** \- Valerie Complex, Deadline Hollywood Daily

A hodgepodge of exuberant stylistic flourishes and pop culture references, and while it’s often briefly entertaining, it’s never consistently anything except manic. - William Bibbiani, TheWrap

With each twist and turn of the story, “Boy Kills World” becomes less involving, though it’s never involving to begin with. Basically, the movie starts at zero and works its way into negative numbers. **0/4** \- Mick LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle

It’s nobody’s masterpiece, but it is an exceptionally promising start for Mohr, making his feature debut as a director. **3.5/5** \- Bill Goodykoontz, Arizona Republic

As a feature-film debut for Moritz Mohr, it's an impressively kinetic calling card with a head-slamming, skin-shredding climax so violent that it could even make Quentin Tarantino say, ""Dude, you might want to dial it back a notch or three."" **3.5/5** \- Cary Darling, Houston Chronicle

It’s a cheeky post-Deadpool comedy – irreverent to a fault – with grindhouse aesthetics that tend to feel inspired by Quentin Tarantino rather than the movies that inspired Quentin Tarantino. - Radheyan Simonpillai, Globe and Mail

Skarsgård is a treat in the role; the character is deaf and mute, so his performance approaches something of a lethal Buster Keaton. **3/5** \- Catherine Bray, Guardian

There’s something inherently lazy about this mash-up of pitch-black comedy, pulpy violence, and sci-fi–dystopia spare parts that cancels all the hard labor it took to make this try-hard with a vengeance. - David Fear, Rolling Stone

If Looney Tunes works because it thinks the way a kid does, then the comparably slap-happy Boy Kills World fails because it has the mentality of a fourteen-year-old boy coming off a three-day, Mountain Dew-fueled Xbox bender. - Charles Bramesco, Little White Lies

A high-octane action extravaganza sure to satiate genre fans’ delirious bloodlust. - Nick Schager, The Daily Beast

If you’re looking for flash and snark, Boy Kills World has them in spades, but it’s too punch-drunk on its own juvenile grandiosity to bother offering even a whiff of substance. **1.5/4** \- Derek Smith, Slant Magazine

It takes a while to smooth out its roughest edges. By the end, it’ll leave you clamoring to join Boy for a match of Super Dragon Punch Force II over a bowl of the sugariest breakfast cereal. And that sums up exactly what type of brawler this is. **3/5** \- Meagan Navarro, Bloody Disgusting

A joyously conceived series of action sequences designed to top the one that came before. - Brian Tallerico, RogerEbert.com

**SYNOPSIS:**

Bill Skarsgård stars as ""Boy"" who vows revenge after his family is murdered by Hilda Van Der Koy (Famke Janssen), the deranged matriarch of a corrupt post-apocalyptic dynasty that left the boy orphaned, deaf and voiceless. Driven by his inner voice, one which he co-opted from his favorite childhood video game, Boy trains with a mysterious shaman (Yayan Ruhian) to become an instrument of death and is set loose on the eve of the annual culling of dissidents. Bedlam ensues as Boy commits bloody martial arts mayhem, inciting a wrath of carnage and blood-letting. As he tries to get his bearings in this delirious realm, Boy soon falls in with a desperate resistance group, all the while bickering with the apparent ghost of his rebellious little sister.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Aliens Re-Release**

- AniNate (That Alien rerelease in two weeks looks to be selling pretty well too (April 15).)

**Boy Kills World Thursday Comp: $0.28M**

- filmlover (Has sold practically nothing near me (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.28M Thursday comp. 0.611x of Vengeance and 0.846x of Bones and All (April 18). Ticket sales on par with Vengeance ($658k opening day) (April 16).)

**Challengers EA+Thursday Comp *excluding abracadabra1998's Mean Girls comp*: $1.35M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.59M EA comp and $0.68M Thursday comp.  $1.85M EA+Thursday Mean Girls comp.  Still not doing great here but with an important caveat that one of the two heaviest pre-sale theaters hasn't released showtimes for Thursday previews for some reason. Whenever it does I can see the pre-sale number bounce up artificially somewhat (April 18). When you separate the EA and the Thursday numbers... not a pretty picture. Really hoping this picks up from here (April 15). This was a very strong start locally, obviously carried by the EA but a good sign of local interest (April 12).)

- Flip (Challengers is selling VERY good, EA shows already close to capacity and still good sales for Thursday (April 12).)

- jeffthehat ($1.24M EA+Thursday comp.)

- JonathanMB (I'm out in the western suburbs of Chicago and do unofficial checks in my area to get a vibe on how a movie is selling, and it's pretty low so far at the AMCs near me, but in Chicago itself it's selling stupid-well, with several Thursday and even Friday evening shows already 50%+ full. So it seems like there will be a bit of a divide in those markets for this (April 23).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.54M EA+Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (I could not run this yesterday and so its 2 days of data and I expect the pace today would be up quite a bit from yesterday. Definitely think potential is there for 20m OW (April 21). Still the pace is not there (April 19). Strong early show sales and looking at previews/Friday, its looking at 20m OW (April 16). So far release looks small. I am not buying a big OW at this point. I double checked my locations and they had... five tickets total sold for EA.  LA looking good though and probably some of the big metros. I was looking at presales for Don't Worry Darling and it wont be easy for Challengers to be that big. Not behaving like a big breakout. I am sure anecdotally doing well in big cities (April 12).)

- TheFlatLannister ($0.95M Thursday comp. Nice increase today (April 19). This is pretty good. Could do $1.5M+ previews (April 18). Pretty big increase today (April 13). Has a good amount of showings but no early signs of a breakout. It's still very early though (April 12).)

- TwoMisfits ($5 tickets are live...but remember, they tend to help Friday and Saturday more than Thursday, b/c if it's $5 anytime, why not go on a weekend night (April 23). Challengers will be a $5 TMobile/Atom deal next week (starting Tuesday) - plan accordingly (April 18).)

**Unsung Hero EA + Thursday previews comp: $2.22M**

- abracadabra1998 ($2.52M EA+Thursday comp. Over 80% of sales are Early Access (April 21).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.92M EA+Thursday comp.  This hasn't shown any growth over the past few days (+4% since Friday) (April 23). It looks like tickets for previews just went on sale today, so I'll check those out tomorrow.  EA is looking really good with a lot of group sales already out there (April 10).)

**Spider-Man 3 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (FWIW sales for the other two Maguire movies the next two weeks are also looking pretty strong as well (3 being impressive considering it's admittedly always been less beloved than the first two) (April 15).)

**Tarot Thursday comp: $0.55M**

- abracadabra1998 (Now at 6 tickets sold lol (April 21). Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- el sid (Showed some small signs of life in my theaters (April 13).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.55M Thursday comp)

**The Fall Guy EA+Thursday previews comp: $3.81M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.42M EA + Thursday comp. Bottom of the U curve this week most likely (April 15).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.42M EA+Thursday Comp. I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 (Again there is almost no pace.  There is still time but unless the pace picks up dramatically, we are looking at a disappointment (April 17).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.98M Thursday comp. Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- vafrow ($1.5M Thursday only comp and $4.6M EA+Thursday comp.  Still crawling along slowly (April 23). A little bit of movement coming out of the weekend (April 22). I eyeballed some other showings in the area that seem to be doing better, so some of my results might be impacted by distortions from a smaller sample (April 21). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point (April 19). A zero sales day after sales spiked a bit a few days ago. I think it lends support to the idea that the SNL appearance did it's job. But with reviews out and now a big public relations win, they're also running out of trigger events to jump sales (April 17). After some progress the day before, fairly quiet today. Zero sales for previews, slight bump on EA (April 16). Starting to see some movement. It's still pretty quiet, but it is moving. I wonder if the SNL appearance helped put some spotlight on this.  The gap in sales between EA and Thursday previews is closing at least (April 15).  EA sales are outpacing the previews by quite a bit. With pretty much every theatre offering EA, I think it's just functioning as opening day (April 13).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.71M**

- abracadabra1998 ($5.59M EA+Thursday comp. Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18). 29% ahead of The Fall Guy on April 15.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.23M EA+Thursday comp. Comps are currently between 3.5m and 4m for previews (including EA) for the most part (April 17).)

- keysersoze123 (Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing like what Quorum is predicting (100% of $90M opening weekend) (April 9).)

- TheFlatLannister ($3.98M Thursday comp)

- Vafrow ($3.3M EA+Thursday comp. Seems to be sluggish. There isn't anything right now that looks like it's going to paint this in a positive light.  The fourth iteration of a franchise reboot should see stronger sales up front (April 21). What's interesting that's probably been in effect for a few weeks now, is that MTC4 has increased the premium for Dolby theatres. I'm pretty sure it was $3 not that long ago. It's now $5. There's been a baseline price increase not that long ago as well. They also added a service fee for booking online tickets about a year ago that's been controversial, and being challenged by Canada's Competition Bureau as a form of drip pricing. It's been a pretty transparent way for the chain to increase revenues, but not adding it to the box office and sharing with studios. I'm not sure if the various price increases has to do with anticipation of having to drop the service fee if they lose the lawsuit. Regardless, this adds a twist to comps. Most big new releases still skew heavily to premium formats, and probably helps push up sales (April 12). Initial rush seems to be over. Not the greatest baseline, but we're still really far out (April 11). It seemed to do a lot better on day 2, but still nothing huge (April 10).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**

- ThomasNicole (Furiosa presales start on May 7 in Brazil.  Normally starts in Brazil the same day or right after US presales start, so it seems like it’ll be a relatively short cycle (April 16).)

**The Garfield Movie EA+Thursday Comp: $3.24M**

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.24M EA+Thursday comp.)

- Porthos (Garfield did pretty decently on its D1 locally, all things considered. And it wasn't even thanks to an EA boost as the lone EA showing up so far has sold exactly one ticket so far. Considering the extreme backloaded nature of the genre + at least some upfront interest due to the Name Brand, not gonna do any comps.  Yet. But I will provide some contrasts. Garfield: 60 tickets sold on Day 1 (EA: 1 ticket sold) [T-31]. Sonic 2: 182 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Minions 2: 67 tickets D-1 [T-24]. Nope: 57 tickets D-1 [T-42]. Elemental: 37 tickets D-1 [T-30]. Wonka: 57 tickets D-1 [T-29]. Mean Girls: 52 tickets D-1 [T-29]. (April 23).)

- vafrow (No sales on Garfield. Kung Fu Panda 4 sold 4 tickets on its first day (April 23).)

To get the elephant out of the room, the Paramount animation brand has been under a lot of pressure after their debut film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge out of Water, which was their only successful film grossing $325 million back in 2015. The studio’s next film was originally The Little Prince due for release on March 18, 2016, but its theatrical release was abruptly cancelled a week prior to its release, due to budget disputes, but odds are, that movie could’ve underperformed due to competition with Disney’s Zootopia, which was doing very strong throughout March 2016. The studio’s next film instead was Monster Trucks on January 13, 2017, which bombed hard grossing $64 million on a budget of $125 million, and losing a serious $123 million. Sherlock Gnomes (a sequel to Gnomeo and Juliet) followed next on March 23, 2018, which also underperformed grossing $90 million on a $59 million budget. Wonder Park was released a year later on March 15, 2019. Produced on a $100 budget, the film earned only $119 million, becoming yet again another box office flop for Paramount. A TV series for Wonder Park was in production for Nickelodeon, but it has since not been released presumably due to the sub-par box office returns for the feature film, so it’s unfortunately likely that the TV series will remain as lost media. Wonder Park would also end up becoming the Paramount Animation’s last theatrical release, as the studio’s preceding films would be released on Paramount+, including The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run &amp; Rumble both in 2021, and the studio’s recent film The Tiger’s Apprentice in early 2024. Under The Boardwalk was also quietly released digitally in late 2023, with little to no press release except for a 2-minute trailer on YouTube. That movie was also planned to release on Paramount+ after having its theatrical release cut, but they’ve seem to have chosen to sweep it under the rug instead, which is pretty saddening. A cancelled film from the studio Shrinking The Treehorns was also sold to Netflix. 


They were other animated films from Paramount that were going to be released under its animated division including Sonic The Hedgehog, PAW Patrol: The Movie, Clifford The Big Red Dog, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, but they were all later dropped from the Paramount Animation brand, and released by Paramount Pictures alone. Most of them were all able to do well without its animated division, except for Clifford. Transformers One seems to still be planned to remain under Paramount Animation. But with that said, the studio’s next movies after Transformers One are also co-produced with Nickelodeon Movies including The Smurfs Movie, The SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants, and Aang: The Last Airbender, which are all very possible to be dropped from Paramount Animation (much like with TMNT: Mutant Mayhem in 2023), and released by Nickelodeon Movies alone leaving PA with no more movies scheduled, with a lot of their movies said to be in development stuck in limbo. Sequels to some of these mentioned movies are also not planned to be under PA. I think the underperformance of Paramount Animation’s theatrical output have likely contributed to other animated movies from Paramount leaving its own animated division, believing they won’t do well. 

So, unless Transformers One is a proven success for sequels, I don’t think Paramount Animation may not stay alive.",10,33

For this analysis, I’ll assign D’Alessandro a letter grade based on his accuracy (A+ for 97-100%, A for 93-96, etc.). Of the 33 films listed, 21 made $100 million as expected, nine made under $100 million (the biggest misfire being *Shazam! Fury of the Gods* with $57.6 million) &amp; three were moved to 2024 (and are thus excluded from this analysis). Four $100 million films (*Sound of Freedom*, *Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour*, *Five Nights at Freddy’s* &amp; *Scream VI*) were excluded from the list.

###**The Boy and the Heron**

The Boy and The Heron remains in 2nd on Monday grossing $0.59M. Total projections slowly creeping up and are now above ¥790M in LC. Thats only around ¥11M short of Suzume. In $ its not gonna be as close as the exchange rate is in the gutter currently.

https://i.imgur.com/Y0AFN76.png


**Audience Figures:**

Scores: Maoyan: 8.8   , Taopiaopiao: 9.4      , Douban: 7.7

The Boy and The Heron's gender split has narrowed a bit through the last few days going from an initial 44-56% lean towards women to a 47-53% split still favoring women. Women still appear to like the movie more with an on average 0.2-0.3 higher rating given to the movie.

&gt;From producer M. Night Shyamalan comes “The Watchers,” written for the screen and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan and based on the novel by A.M. Shine. The film follows Mina, a 28-year-old artist, who gets stranded in an expansive, untouched forest in western Ireland. When Mina finds shelter, she unknowingly becomes trapped alongside three strangers who are watched and stalked by mysterious creatures each night.

&gt;You can’t see them, but they see everything.

&gt;“The Watchers” stars Dakota Fanning (“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” “Ocean’s Eight”), Georgina Campbell (“Barbarian,” “Suspicion”), Oliver Finnegan (“Creeped Out,” “Outlander”) and Olwen Fouere (“The Northman,” “The Tourist”). The film is produced by M. Night Shyamalan, Ashwin Rajan and Nimitt Mankad. The executive producers are Jo Homewood and Stephen Dembitzer.

&gt;Joining writer/director Shyamalan behind-the-camera are director of photography Eli Arenson (“Lamb,” “Hospitality”), production designer Ferdia Murphy (“Lola,” “Finding You”), editor Job ter Burg (“Benedetta,” “Elle”) and costume design by Frank Gallacher (“Sebastian,” “Aftersun”). The music is by Abel Korzeniowski (“Till,” “The Nun”).

M3GAN (1.6.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $30,429,860

Domestic: $95,043,350

Foreign: $81,768,182

Worldwide: $176,811,532

RT: 93%

Edit: Thanks to ""M3GAN"" going viral on social media, and with solid promotion, young audiences showed up, and allowed this film to easily break even, and will likely do well on digital as well.

Plane (1.13.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $10,265,326

Domestic: $32,111,181

Foreign: $17,946,750

Worldwide: $50,057,931

RT: 77%

Edit: Possibly thanks to the good reception, ""Plane"" was able to have a decent opening, but it's still a mediocre result for the action flick.

A Man Called Otto (1.13.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend (Wide): $12,828,785

Domestic: $64,267,657

Foreign: $44,731,861

Worldwide: $108,999,518

RT: 69%

Edit: Thanks to the Midwest and Southern audiences who will still show up for Tom Hanks' movies, older audiences helped to propel this film to a solid gross worldwide. However, the high budget stands in the way of this film being a true success at the box office. However, it's doing great on digital and streaming, proving that Tom Hanks still holds a good amount of star power, especially among older audiences.

Missing (1.20.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $9,154,695

Domestic: $32,502,025

Foreign: $32,502,025

Worldwide: $45,100,756

RT: 87%

Edit: The good reception and minimal competition to ""Missing"" helped it to have a decent performance, increasing from ""Searching"" domestically.

Knock at the Cabin (2.3.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $14,127,170

Domestic: $35,397,980

Foreign: $19,053,487

Worldwide: $54,451,467

RT: 67%

Edit: While should be profitable with just the $20M budget, this is still a pretty big disappointment for M. Night Shyamala, becoming his lowest-grossing film of his career, falling below 'Lady in the Water', and couldn't even surpass 'Old', which was released when COVID-19 was still significantly affecting the box office. This could be due to how Universal basically dumped in early February, and that the M. Night doesn't have the same pull at the box office like he used to, grossing a fraction of what 'Split' and 'Glass' made worldwide.

80 For Brady (2.3.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $12,701,640

Domestic: $39,330,588

Foreign: $385,086

Worldwide: $39,715,674

RT: 62%

Edit: The box office for ""80 for Brady"" proves that the film was able to find its audience, which are older moviegoers, especially with the discounted tickets, and being close to the 57th Super Bowl, plus Tom Brady announcing his retirement, and propelled it to a solid box office. However, the $28m budget prevented the film from being profitable at the B.O., but should easily make it back with revenue from digital and streaming.

Magic Mike’s Last Dance (2.10.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $8,305,317

Domestic: $26,005,156

Foreign: $30,286,821

Worldwide: $56,291,977

RT: 49%

Edit: While not a disastrous result for the ""Magic Mike"" threequel, Warner Bros. Discovery's thrifty theatrical opening, releasing in just 1,500 theaters, likely film prevented it from having a better opening. It also doesn't help that 'Last Dance' is such a major deviation from the previous installments, driving away some of the fans of the series. Despite expanding to 3,000 theaters in its 2nd weekend, it didn't do much for the legs, and with the $60M+ for production costs and marketing, it seems like the film is a flop.

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2.17.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $106,109,650 ($120,394,617 4-Day)

Edit: While the opening for the film is pretty good for the 'Ant-Man' franchise, the problem is the terrible legs ""Quantumania"" is had. It has some of the worst weekend drops in the MCU, domestically and overseas. And worldwide, it has to struggle to surpass the 1st ""Ant-Man"" film, let alone surpassing 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' $622M gross, and if this film can't improve on previous ""Ant-Man"" entries, despite a bigger budget, scale, marketing, and villain, then what are we doing here Marvel? With the $200M+ budget, barely breaking even with box office and digital included, this makes 'Quantumania' one of the biggest disappointments in Marvel Studios history.

Cocaine Bear (2.24.23)

Foreign: $21,627,048

Worldwide: $86,005,378

Edit: Even if the concept is so outrageous, Universal cleverly marketed this movie through social media platforms, and the good-enough reception from critics and audiences (B CinemaScore) has propelled ""Cocaine Bear"" to an overperforming opening weekend and U.S. gross. While it may have faltered overseas, Universal should still see a decent return on investment, a win for the company, and even Elizabeth Banks as a director.

Jesus Revolution (2.24.23)

Domestic: $52,095,353

Foreign: $227,722

Worldwide: $52,323,075

Edit: Due to the lack of Christian films in this market, and solid exposure from Lionsgate, ""Jesus Revolution"" has able to have a solid opening weekend and great legs domestically, being immensely well-received amongst Christian audiences, easily being profitable for Lionsgate, being a much-needed win for the studio.

Creed III (3.3.23)

Opening Weekend: $58,370,007

Domestic: $156,248,615

Foreign: $118,200,000

RT: 89%

Edit: The ""Rocky"" and ""Creed"" brand is as strong as ever with audiences, proven by ""Creed III"", which well overperformed compared to expectations, delivering the biggest debut for a film in the ""Rocky"" universe, and for sports films in general, and is also good for everyone involved, especially Michael B. Jordan and Jonathan Majors (At least until the domestic-violence charges). It's also a well needed win for MGM, with the solid audience reception, plus the good legs throughout a crowded March. And if this proves anything, it's that Amazon is becoming stronger at creating box office successes.

Scream VI (3.10.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $44,447,270

Domestic: $108,161,389

Foreign: $60,672,743

Worldwide: $168,834,132

RT: 77%

Edit: ""Scream VI"" proves that the ""Scream"" franchise is as strong as ever, besting the biggest debut of the franchise by over $10m, and becoming one of the highest grossing horror-films of the year domestically. This can be attributed to the strong marketing campaign, bigger than any other ""Scream"" movie. And thanks to social media, and the rising popularity of Jenna Ortega, ""Scream VI"" continued a very solid March.

Edit: While not horrible for ""65"", Universal seems to still have a strong hold on the dinosaurs. ""65"" delivers an underwhelming performance for the sci-fi/horror flick, with bad critical and audience reception. And now, the film is unlikely to break even with the $45m budget, adding to the pile of underperforming Sony films.

Edit: With all of the competition from other, bigger March blockbusters in the market, ""Champions"" was unable to stand out, and delivered a weak performance for the Focus Feature/Universal film. Thankfully, audience reception is strong, and is having decent holds to make up for the lackluster performance.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods (3.17.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $30,111,158

Domestic: $57,638,006

Foreign: $74,567,092

Worldwide: $132,205,098

RT: 49%

Edit: It seems as if the DCEU couldn't be rebooted soon enough. ""Shazam! Fury of the Gods"" delivered the 3rd worst debut for a DCEU film, falling behind ""Birds of Prey"", and is barely ahead of ""The Suicide Squad"". It also became the lowest grossing film in DCEU history worldwide, falling behind 'Wonder Woman 1984'. One factor is the poor marketing. This film didn't have an interesting hook the same way as the 1st ""Shazam!"" did. It was also released in a crowded market, with ""Scream VI"", 'John Wick', and ""Creed III"". And the DCEU don't have the popularity and the good will to create box office hits. And with a mediocre audience and critical reception, plus the awful legs, this looks to be another DCEU bomb.

John Wick: Chapter 4 (3.24.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $73,817,950

RT: 94%

Edit: This March, the good just keeps coming (expect Shazam II), especially with the debut of ""John Wick: Chapter 4"". The Chad Stahelski action sequel easily delivers what looks to be the 2nd highest grossing R-Rated film post-pandemic, and the biggest Lionsgate film since ""The Hunger Games"" movies. This can all be attributed to the strong brand Lionsgate, Chad Stahelski, and Keanu Reeves built throughout the years in ""John Wick"" all the way back in 2014 with the word-of-mouth hit ""John Wick"", and with Chapter 2 &amp; 3 back in 2017 and 2019 respectively. And with great early reviews that led up to the film's release, a solid ad campaign, and an A CinemaScore, this will easily be a huge hit for everyone involved. Let's see how the JWCU (John Wick Cinematic Universe) will fare after Chapter Four with ""Ballerina"".

Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (3.31.23)

RT: 91%

Edit: While the result could potentially be worse, this is still a weak result for ""Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves"". With an over 60% drop in its 2nd weekend, and its lack of significant legs, worldwide, this film seems like a bomb for Paramount, despite the immensely positive reception from critics and audiences across the board. Even if Paramount lowered the $150m budget, it still seems unlikely to turn any profit in the theatrical window, affecting the chance of it becoming a new franchise for Paramount. Maybe with a better release date, it could've broken out. But with the competition from ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""John Wick 4"", trapping the film in a box office corner, it became one of the bigger bombs of 2023.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie (4.5.23)

Opening Weekend: $146,361,865 ($204,630,730 5-Day)

Sunday Edit: ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"" keeps on breaking records. It had broken numerous records, including the biggest 5-day weekend, the biggest worldwide opening for an animated film, the biggest video-game adaptation of all time, and the 3rd biggest animated film of all time. Looking beyond that, it's currently the 2nd highest grossing film of 2023, just behind ""Barbie"", and has well surpassed $1b worldwide, with a great debut and gross in Japan, Mexico, U.K., etc. Who's to thank? The Mario IP carries multi-generational appeal, from the youngest child to the oldest person. Illumination also likes to market their big films like crazy ('Rise of Gru had a $140m marketing cost). And when they both combine, they were able to please audiences and fans alike with an A CinemaScore, and deliver a record setting performance.

Air (4.5.23)

RT (100+ Reviews): 92%

Sunday Edit: Despite the utter beast that is ""Super Mario Bros."", ""Air"" was still able to attract a solid debut for an adult oriented movie, with over a $20m debut domestic, and a solid worldwide performance. And with an A CinemaScore, and having pretty good legs. While it won't break even with a $90m budget, I doubt Amazon is too concerned, as it's more of a streaming play than a major theatrical release.

Edit: It seems like the line-up of Universal's B-movies has had a clunker with ""Renfield"". Despite buzz around Nicolas Cage as Dracula, the Chris McKay vampire comedy opened to just above $8m, and with a B- CinemaScore, it had little-to-no legs throughout April, especially with horror competition from ""The Pope's Exorcist"" and ""Evil Dead Rise"". This could also be due to Universal being obviously focused on ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie"", rightfully so. And with horror competition throughout April, plus having little appeal, it became a pretty big flop for Universal.

The Pope’s Exorcist (4.14.23)

Opening Weekend: $9,006,368

Foreign: $32,897,023

Edit: Despite little-to-no interest initially, Sony was able to salvage ""The Pope's Exorcist"" despite mixed reception, leading to an okay debut amidst a sea of competition. While not great, its solid news for Russel Crowe as a star, though likely won't be too significant in the long run.

Evil Dead Rise (4.21.23)

Actual Results:

Opening Weekend: $24,504,315

Foreign: $78,785,285

Edit: After a rough few months for Warner Bros. Discovery, they finally have their first hit with ""Evil Dead Rise"". The 5th installment in the franchise has done immensely well throughout April, bringing in a solid gross, and good word of mouth and reception from critics and audiences. This performance looks to be a winner for everyone involved, showing that this franchise still has some 'groove' to it.

Edit: It seems as if the days of Guy Ritchie being a big director are gone, as ""The Covenant"" is another bomb for the acclaimed director. Even if it does have some solid audience and critical reception, it doesn't seem to be enough to drive audiences to the theater. However, it was a solid hit on digital and streaming, and should make its money back there.

Beau is Afraid (4.14.23 Limited | 4.21.23 Wide)

Edit: While ""Beau is Afraid"" is a per-theater darling, with the biggest since ""Uncut Gems"" back in 2019, the divided reception from critics and audiences, along with the $35m budget, means that it's unlikely ""Beau is Afraid"" will break even, and will lose money for A24.

Edit: Even with previous success in the religious market with ""Jesus Revolution"", ""Margaret"" seems to be a misfire, with an immensely weak opening domestically. The original book doesn't have the popularity today like it had back closer to when the book debuted, and how it's not as Christian friendly as 'Jesus Revolution'. While it does have great reception from critics and audiences, competition from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""The Little Mermaid"" would prevent it from having any legs, making this movie a flop.

Edit: For a release with a major studio behind it, and a release in over 3,000 theaters, ""Big George Foreman"" just barely made over six million in it's total worldwide run, an absolute embarrassment of a performance. And with weak reception across the board, this film was D.O.A. at the box office.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (5.5.23)

RT: 82%

Edit: While the opening weekend was a rough start for the James Gunn film, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' proves how word-of-mouth matters, as it has had some of the best holds in the MCU, with the best 2nd weekend in the MCU since 'Black Panther'. And with strong international numbers, especially from China, it's final gross is on-par with 'Vol. 2'. This shows that while superhero fatigue may be in full swing, audiences will show up for a quality film about characters they care about, resulting a solid amount of money. 'Guardians 3' also defies the 60%+ drops the MCU is having, and since the good legs continued throughout its run, it should be a win for both Marvel and especially James Gunn.

Edit: 'Love Again' seems to be another Sony flop. With a gross of just barely $10m, horrible reviews, and releasing on the same day as 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' the film was definitely DOA at the box office. And with no hook other than new songs by Celine Dion, it would've been best if it just went straight to streaming than going theatrical.

Edit: While not a horrible result for this ever-growing family, maybe it's time to keep the car in the garage. It's the lowest debut in the series since 2006, with even 'F9' ($70m) finishing above it in its opening. And it's easily the most expensive in the franchise with a $340m budget. Why is this? Ever since 2009, there has been a 'F&amp;F' movie every two years if we include 'Hobbs and Shaw'. Ever since 2017, the franchise has been experiencing diminishing grosses, yet with the budgets increasing. While doing well internationally, domestic audiences may be suffering from Fast fatigue. Universal is aware of this, as they plan on ending the franchise with one last movie on a lower budget.

Edit: 'The Little Mermaid' is alo a mixed bag of a box office performance.  The remake did have d a solid opening and a good domestic gross. The word-of-mouth was great domestically, with an A CinemaScore and a decent critical score. International, while started immensely weak with a $68m debut, did somewhat rally with $270m overseas, especially thanks to Japan. While China and Korea rejected the film, it did have good word of mouth in many other countries and grossed over $570M worldwide. However, with a massive $250m budget, and coming short of many other live action remakes (Aladdin ($1.05B), Jungle Book( $960M), Lion King ($1.6B), it's an okay box office total, but likely not the result Disney was hoping for.

Edit: Five years ago, 'Into the Spider-Verse' opened to just $35m during December. Now, in June 2023, 'Across the Spider-Verse' dazzled with a debut of over $208m worldwide, and $120m domestic, the 8th biggest of all time for an animated film, and in end, grossing nearly $700M, the 2nd biggest animated film this year, the highest grossing CBM of the year domestically, and doubled the gross of 'Into' domestically, and nearly worldwide, easily making it one of the biggest films this year. Thanks to the continuous popularity of the Spider-Man brand, the ever-growing popularity of Miles Moralses, and 'Into the Spider-Verse' being a juggernaut on streaming, 'Across the Spider-Verse' was able to nearly double the worldwide gross of the 1st film, and also become of the most profitable films of the year, a true success for Sony and the Spider-Man brand.

RT: 52%

Edit: While not a horrible performance of any means, it seems like 'Rise of the Beasts' can't take on this crowded summer, with the film falling below 'Bumblebee' worldwide. And while doing decently internationally, it hasn't lit the box office on fire in most territories. This shows that while there is still some interest in Transformers in film, the days of billion-dollar films are long gone. It was also too soon to come out with another installment in the franchise, and with the horrible release date it was given, it seems to be shaping up as a bit of a dud for Paramount at the box office, especially with the $200m budget.

RT: 74%

Edit: After a rough few years at the box office for Pixar, the trend is starting to get better with the release of Pixar's 'Elemental'. After a very rough opening weekend of $29.6M, the 2nd lowest in Pixar history, thanks to great audience scores, shown by the A CinemaScore, plus no animated competition releasing until 'TMNT' in early August, it has shown remarkable legs at the box office, surpassing both 'Lightyear', 'The Good Dinosaur' and many other Pixar films worldwide, showing the immense power of word-of-mouth. This also shows that there's still interest in Disney/Pixar animated films, a good sign for 'Wish', coming out in November. It's also a win for animation in general, proving that original animation still has potential at the box office. While the $200m budget is a detractor to its success, the fact that it will break even after all is remarkable, showing that the Pixar brand is alive.

RT: 63%

Edit: What a disaster. For months now, Warner Bros. Discovery has been praising 'The Flash' non-stop, and trying to spread goodwill around the film with CinemaCon, early fan-screenings, and multiple celebrities calling it one of the great superhero movies. Promotion was also immensely present for the Andy Muschietti film. There was a Superbowl ad, constant TV promotion, and billboards across cities. All of that, for a film that might not even reach $300m worldwide on a budget of $220m. Why did 'The Flash' flop so hard? It's not a simple question though. One reason is the controversial figure that is Ezra Miller. For the past years, there have been many reports of Ezra Miller's crimes, such as grooming, breaking-and-entering, physical assault, etc., thus being a major turn-off to the film. Another reason is the completely broken DCEU. For the past years, there has been nothing but bombs, flops, and underperformances for the cinematic universe, starting back in early 2020 with 'Birds of Prey'. And each of these bombs hinders the DC brand, making it a label that people don't want to be associated with amongst the general audience. And the nostalgia angle wasn't effective, as Michael Keaton as Batman doesn't carry much nostalgia especially considering all the other, more popular interpretations of the cape crusader, and the many cameos in the movie were not received well. Speaking of that, audiences seem to completely reject the movie, giving it a B CinemaScore, tied for the lowest in the DCEU. And with the -72% drop in the 2nd weekend, plus failing to reach a 2x multiplier. So, in all, this was a complete failure for everyone involved, and no amount of manufactured praise can save this movie.

Edit: Amidst all of the June underperformers, Sony can at least celebrate that 'No Hard Feelings' did okay at the box office, with a decent total weekend, both domestic and worldwide. And while the $45m budget does slightly hinder its performance, it should easily make it back on digital. While not a fantastic debut, it does show that Jennifer Lawrence is still a solid box office draw, despite her break. And with decent reception with a 68% RT and a B+ CinemaScore, it could have decent legs throughout its run.

Worldwide: $383,229,928

RT: 69%

Edit: Another addition to the list of summer box office bombs of 2023. Being the 1st Indiana Jones film in 15 years, it made less than half of what 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' made 15 years ago non-adjusted for inflation and is easily the lowest grossing Indy film by far when adjusted for inflation, especially when you consider that the original trilogy came out over 40 years ago at this point. And with the $300M budget, plus a sizable marketing budget, 'Dial of Destiny' will go down as one of the biggest box office failures of all time. Why did this happen? For starters, the Indiana Jones franchise was significantly past its prime, especially with the mixed reactions to 'Crystal Skull'. This isn't a 'Top Gun' or a 'No Way Home' situation, since there was little interest in seeing the story of Indiana Jones continue, and the reception wasn't nearly as good as the original trilogy, both with critics and audiences. 'Dial of Destiny' got a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes, not bad, but the lowest in the franchise. It also got a B+ CinemaScore, just above the B 'Crystal Skull' got (though 'Raiders' and 'Temple of Doom' were released before CinemaScore became a thing). Overall, this will go down as a stain on most people involved with this film, and as one of the biggest box office bomb of 2023.",4,25

","A Simple Favor 2 is slated to exclusively be released on Prime Video sometime next year. Given that the first did pretty well commercially ($97 million on a $20 million budget), I find it a little surprising that they’re not releasing the follow-up in theaters and instead are dumping it on Prime Video. Though I’m sure contracts are already in place regarding it staying a streaming exclusive, I wonder how well it would do if they were to pull an Evil Dead Rise/Final Destination: Bloodlines and scrap their initial plans to make it a streaming exclusive and instead release it in theaters. 

I honestly think that it would do pretty well if they decided to give it a theatrical release. The first film has become somewhat of a modern cult classic amongst both gay women and fans of the erotic thriller genre, and I think the goodwill it has would make people interested in checking it out. The only downside is that it has been almost a decade since the first film came out, and the long break between the two films might hurt its chances of succeeding if they were to give it a theatrical release.",3,12

Ghostbuster: It opened to 253k which is about 62% of what Afterlife opened too. The CGV score is awful with 77 which means the legs will be awful. I won't be shocked if this fails to hit half of Afterlife's total. 

The First Omen: A 40% drop from last weekend as it has been dropping good for a US made horror movie. I think this will be a hit in streaming

Dune 2: A 45% increase from last weekend. 2 million admits went from being a miss to being a lock. I do wonder what will happen when Roundup 4 comes in and eats everyone's screens.

Upcoming horror movies slated for 2024 releases such as Alien Romulus, A Quiet Place Day One, MaXXXine, Nightbitch, Nosferatu, Tarot, Terrifier 3, The Watchers, The Strangers Chapters 1, 2 and 3 and Trap should be considering at the box office depending if it’s good and if it interests the audiences.

[Last September](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sound-freedom-hit-why-isn-232135441.html) Scott Mendelson reported that 

&gt; “Like any independent film, we ran out of money,” Monteverde told TheWrap. “I decided to sell my points to the producers so we could finish the picture.”

which was true but ended up being less significant in the grand scheme of things. He ended up snagging a surprisingly big deal from the studio to continue to work with them to try and make anything remotely close to Sound of Freedom again. 

&gt; In February 2024, the Company entered into a 10-year Director Employment Agreement (the “Director’s Agreement”) with Alejandro Monteverde (“Mr. Monteverde”) to direct a minimum of five (5) potential feature-length theatrical motion pictures to be distributed by Angel Studios. To qualify as one of the five (5) required theatrical motion pictures, the motion picture directed and delivered by Mr. Monteverde must receive a “theatrical worthy” rating from the Angel Guild. Should the motion picture delivered not meet the threshold required to be considered “theatrical worthy”, the motion picture will not count towards the five (5) motion pictures required under the Director’s Agreement. The Director’s Agreement stipulates that Mr. Monteverde will become an employee of Angel Studios, with key responsibilities being 1) to attend, in person or via videoconference certain meetings wherein Mr. Monteverde will be asked for feedback and advice on other motion pictures that Angel Studios is distributing, 2) to review, consult, and recommend edits to scripts for other Angel Studios projects, 3) to review, consult, and recommend edits for Angel Studios projects in the post-production phase, 4) to mentor existing writers, directors, and producers working with Angel Studios on other projects, and 5) all other duties as outlined in the Director’s Agreement.

It's not clear what backend (if any) is included in Monteverde's future films (Director's Agreement is self-evidently not included in the filing).

******
[compensation section]

For services performed, and for as long as Mr. Monteverde remains an employee of Angel Studios, Angel Studios will pay the following compensation as outlined in the Director’s Agreement:

 

1. Angel Studios will pay to Monteverde Films, Inc., an up front fee of $950,000 (the “Finder’s Fee”). The Finders Fee will be earned out over the first 52 weeks of the agreement, and should Mr. Monteverde no longer be employed by Angel Studios during the initial fifty-two (52) week period, the Finder’s fee shall be recoupable by Angel Studios in an amount equal to the weeks of unused service.
2. Mr. Monteverde will earn a salary during the first year of the Agreement of $50,000, to be paid in accordance with Angel Studios standard payroll practices.
3. Mr. Monteverde’s salary will increase in year two (2) and year three (3) of the agreement to $600,000 per year.
4. Angel Studios has agreed to purchase a house for Mr. Monteverde with a retail value of between $4 - $5 million at a location of Mr. Monteverde’s choosing. Mr. Monteverde will earn ten percent (10%) of the value of the house for each year of service under the Director’s Agreement, which ownership will be transferred to Mr. Monteverde on an annual basis.
 5. Mr. Monteverde’s salary for years four (4) through ten (10) will be adjusted depending on the price of the house purchased, with the total compensation paid being equivalent on a net present value basis to $12 million, with $6 million being paid up front, and $6 million paid out monthly over the ten (10) year employment period.
6. Mr. Monteverde will be granted an option to purchase up to 116,000 shares of the Company’s Class F common stock at the fair market value of the shares at the time the option is approve and granted by the Board. These options will vest in 10 equal annual installments over the term of the Director’s Agreement for as long as Mr. Monteverde remains employed by the Company.
7. Mr. Monteverde will be granted an option to purchase up to 40,000 shares of the Company’s Class F common stock, at the fair market value of the shares at the time the option is approved and granted by the Board. Should Mr. Monteverde direct and deliver more than five (5) motion pictures for Angel Studios to distribute over the term of the Director’s Agreement, one-fifth (1/5th) or 8,000 options will vest for each motion picture delivered beyond the initial five (5) motion pictures, up to a maximum of ten (10) motion pictures.

This sums up ***Twisters***, ***Horizon: An American Saga***, ***Beetlejuice Beetlejuice***, ***Joker: Folie à Deux***, ***Wicked: Part One*** and ***Gladiator II*** in one paragraph.

**TWISTERS** *(July 19)*

***Pros***

• The original *Twister* grossed almost *$500M* back in '96.

• Just like *Top Gun*, there have been no follow-up attempts to *Twister* in any media or form until now.

• *Twister* was also the first movie to be released on DVD, so almost everyone has had fond memories of watching it at their homes over the years, even if they did not initially catch it in cinemas.

• **Daisy Edgar-Jones** and **Glen Powell** have proven their box office chops with the success of *Where the Crawdads Sing* and *Anyone but You* respectively.

***Cons***

• The movie carries a **$200M** budget.

• Unlike *Maverick* with **Cruise**, there are no returning characters from the original *Twister*, though hardly a fair comparison, since the twisters are the main characters here.

**HORIZON: AN AMERICAN SAGA** *(* **CHAPTER 1** *June 28 and* **CHAPTER 2** *Aug 16)*

***Pros***

• **Kevin Costner** with his newfound fame of *Yellowstone*, stars and produces and directs this epic saga.

• As a *Western drama*, which we don't get too many of those nowadays, might play in the movie's favour, with audiences looking for something different than the typical Hollywood fare.

***Cons***

• A two-part feature with both parts to release in the summer, in the space of seven weeks of each other, which can either prosper or backfire.

• **$100M** budget for each part.

**BEETLEJUICE BEETLEJUICE** *(September 6)*

***Pros***

• **Micheal Keaton** reprises his role as *Betelgeuse* while **Winona Ryder** and **Catherine O'Hara** also return alongwith the addition of **Jenna Ortega**, of *Wednesday* fame, to the cast.

• PG-13 horror can do quite well theatrically with those being the only kind of horror movies to have delivered a profit in 2024.

***Cons***

• **Tim Burton** has been mostly off his game for almost two decades now.

**JOKER: FOLIE À DEUX** *(October 4)*

***Pros***

• The original *Joker* made a billion dollars back in 2019 and still remains the only R-rated movie to do so.

• **Lady Gaga** as *Harley Quinn* in the sequel.

• *Joker: Folie à Deux* will also screen in IMAX 70 mm format.

• Biggest trailer launch for Warner Bros. since *Barbie* with 167M views in the first 24 hours.

Cons

• The sequel is also a jukebox musical.

• **$200M** budget

• Superhero genre is not as hot as it was five years ago when *Joker* was released.

**WICKED** *(Nov 27)*

***Pros***

• A feature film adaptation of one of the most popular Broadway shows, running well over two decades since it opened back in 2003.

• **Ariana Grande** plays the *Good Witch*.

***Cons***

• Two-part film adaptation with the next part to arrive on Thanksgiving 2025.

• Competition with *Moana 2*, also a musical, opening on the same day.

**GLADIATOR II** *(Nov 22)*

***Pros***
 
• Sequel to the Oscar winner of 2000 and also the second highest grossing movie of the year.

• Strong cast round up comprising the evergreen **Denzel Washington**, ubiquitous **Pedro Pascal**, *Normal People's* **Paul Mescal**, *Stranger Things'* **Joseph Quinn** and **Connie Nielsen** reprising her role from the original *Gladiator*.

• The best thing to come out of CinemaCon 2024 with the first footage revealed recieving the loudest and wildest cheers from the crowd, with &gt;!*Gladiator II* going completely batshit crazy with underwater battles with sharks, baboons and rhinos.!&lt;

***Cons***

• **Ridley Scott** has been hit or miss since *The Martian* which was almost a decade ago.

• **Russell Crowe** and **Joaquin Phoenix** understandably, do not reprise their roles, though it may be for the best, since in trying to shoehorn them in the sequel somehow, we get another *Palpatine*.

• Atleast a **$250M** budget.",428,2697

#**Weekend Box Office (April 19th-21th)**

First off all. Massive thanks for everyone that suggested me for the flair &lt;3. This post has now been daily for over a year at this point. Its been a pleasure doing them and thanks for everyone that checks them out. Hopefully they continue going for at least another year to come.

Second of all massive shotout to everyone else who was nominated as well. You guys do great work and make this subreddit better with the content you provide. 

GxK stomps back into the lead this weekend edging out The Boy and The Heron.

Behind Viva La Vida edges out KFP4 after a great hold. Although the latter also puts in a good shift only dropping -21%.

Digimon Adventure 02 opens only in 6th after a pretty sharp Sunday drop.

The other new releases also don't make much of an impact opening in the lower reaches of the top 10.

**DOMESTIC PRESALES**

**Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (FWIW sales for the other two Maguire movies the next two weeks are also looking pretty strong as well (3 being impressive considering it's admittedly always been less beloved than the first two) (April 15).)

**Aliens Re-Release**

- AniNate (That Alien rerelease in two weeks looks to be selling pretty well too (April 15).)

**Boy Kills World Thursday Comp: $0.33M**

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.33M Thursday comp. 0.611x of Vengeance and 0.846x of Bones and All (April 18). Ticket sales on par with Vengeance ($658k opening day) (April 16).)

**Challengers EA+Thursday Comp *including abracadabra1998's Mean Girls comp separately*: $1.6M**

- abracadabra1998 ($0.58M EA comp and $0.66M Thursday comp.  $2M EA+Thursday Mean Girls comp.  Still not doing great here but with an important caveat that one of the two heaviest pre-sale theaters hasn't released showtimes for Thursday previews for some reason. Whenever it does I can see the pre-sale number bounce up artificially somewhat (April 18). When you separate the EA and the Thursday numbers... not a pretty picture. Really hoping this picks up from here (April 15). This was a very strong start locally, obviously carried by the EA but a good sign of local interest (April 12).)

- Flip (Challengers is selling VERY good, EA shows already close to capacity and still good sales for Thursday (April 12).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($1.56M EA+Thursday comp.)

- keysersoze123 (Still the pace is not there (April 19). Strong early show sales and looking at previews/Friday, its looking at 20m OW (April 16). So far release looks small. I am not buying a big OW at this point. I double checked my locations and they had... five tickets total sold for EA.  LA looking good though and probably some of the big metros. I was looking at presales for Don't Worry Darling and it wont be easy for Challengers to be that big. Not behaving like a big breakout. I am sure anecdotally doing well in big cities (April 12).)

- TheFlatLannister ($0.95M Thursday comp. Nice increase today (April 19). This is pretty good. Could do $1.5M+ previews (April 18). Pretty big increase today (April 13). Has a good amount of showings but no early signs of a breakout. It's still very early though (April 12).)

- TwoMisfits (Challengers will be a $5 TMobile/Atom deal next week (starting Tuesday) - plan accordingly (April 18).)

**Unsung Hero EA + Thursday previews comp: $2.57M**

- katnisscinnaplex ($2.57M EA+Thursday comp. It looks like tickets for previews just went on sale today, so I'll check those out tomorrow.  EA is looking really good with a lot of group sales already out there (April 10).)

**Spider-Man 3 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (FWIW sales for the other two Maguire movies the next two weeks are also looking pretty strong as well (3 being impressive considering it's admittedly always been less beloved than the first two) (April 15).)

**Tarot Thursday comp: $0.62M**

- abracadabra1998 (Tarot only has 2 theaters sold in all the 25 theaters (April 18).)

- el sid (Showed some small signs of life in my theaters (April 13).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($0.62M Thursday comp)

**The Fall Guy EA+Thursday previews comp *excluding Vafrow*: $3.74M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.8M EA + Thursday comp. Bottom of the U curve this week most likely (April 15).)

- katnisscinnaplex ($3.67M EA+Thursday Comp. I'm not saying this is going to earn 5m+ in total previews, but we shouldn't get all doom and gloom yet (April 18).)

- keysersoze123 (Again there is almost no pace.  There is still time but unless the pace picks up dramatically, we are looking at a disappointment (April 17).)

- TheFlatLannister ($2.98M Thursday comp. Pretty much ~$3M right now (April 18).)

- vafrow ($1.3M Thursday only comp and $5.3M EA+Thursday comp.  Another zero sales day. I added in comps. Even throwing in EA sales still doesn't paint a great picture (April 20). Another zero sales day. Yes, final week and walk ups are what's going to matter in the end, but we should be seeing something at this point. We're two weeks out now (April 19). It moved a bit, but we do need to start seeing something soon if it's going to happen (April 18). A zero sales day after sales spiked a bit a few days ago. I think it lends support to the idea that the SNL appearance did it's job. But with reviews out and now a big public relations win, they're also running out of trigger events to jump sales (April 17). After some progress the day before, fairly quiet today. Zero sales for previews, slight bump on EA (April 16). It's been so slow that I wasn't going to bother posting daily updates until this weekend, but we're starting to see some movement. It's still pretty quiet, but it is moving. I wonder if the SNL appearance helped put some spotlight on this. I'm still keeping the separate comps for EA vs non EA. But the gap in sales between the two is closing at least (April 15). I'm really unsure how to handle the EA sales at this point. It's outpacing the previews by quite a bit. With pretty much every theatre offering EA, I think it's just functioning as opening day (April 13). Nothing is happening on sales this far out. The EA show is difficult to track due to site glitches (April 6).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes EA+Thursday previews comp: $4.45M**

- abracadabra1998 ($3.66M EA+Thursday comp. Keeps climbing, decent pace so far (April 18). 29% ahead of The Fall Guy on April 15.)

- katnisscinnaplex ($5.23M EA+Thursday comp. Comps are currently between 3.5m and 4m for previews (including EA) for the most part (April 17).)

- keysersoze123 (Again minus early shows, presales are moribund (April 17). Presales does not scream a huge breakout. Early shows have good presales but that is just it. Definitely nothing like what Quorum is predicting (100% of $90M opening weekend) (April 9).)

- Porthos ($3.55M Thursday comp (excluding Nope and Aquaman 2 which are $11.5M and $8.6M). Like, I have *no idea* how to interpret all of this thanks to the week of exclusive PLF-only sales. That, along with the length of the pre-sale window, is playing merry havoc with any reasonable comps I might be looking at here. Reasonably impressed with the level of D1 for all shows sales today.  I think (April 9).)

- Relevation (Looks like standard tickets are now on sale for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (April 8).)

- TheFlatLannister ($3.98M Thursday comp)

- Vafrow ($0.6M Thursday comp. What's interesting that's probably been in effect for a few weeks now, is that MTC4 has increased the premium for Dolby theatres. I'm pretty sure it was $3 not that long ago. It's now $5. There's been a baseline price increase not that long ago as well. They also added a service fee for booking online tickets about a year ago that's been controversial, and being challenged by Canada's Competition Bureau as a form of drip pricing. This has been interesting, as it's been a pretty transparent way for the chain to increase revenues, but not adding it to the box office and sharing with studios. I'm not sure if the various price increases has to do with anticipation of having to drop the service fee if they lose the lawsuit. Regardless, this adds a twist to comps. Most big new releases still skew heavily to premium formats, and probably helps push up sales (April 12). The initial rush seems to be over. Not the greatest baseline, but we're still really far out (April 11). It seemed to do a lot better on day 2, but still nothing huge. I'll probably take some time on the weekend to try and figure out a comp strategy (April 10). The preview sales went up yesterday, but EA has been open for a week. It's hard to really compare this to anything. Especially since it continues the trend of Fall Guy with EA shows the day before that's almost as wide as the preview showings.  In terms of Fall Guy, it's opened stronger, but it's also an established brand vs something original, and also only opening a month before instead of two. Also, everyone was busy with the eclipse in the region (April 9).)

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Monday Re-Release**

- filmlover (Have actually sold a fairly decent amount of seats so far (April 15).)

**Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga**

- ThomasNicole (Furiosa presales start on May 7 in Brazil.  Normally starts in Brazil the same day or right after US presales start, so it seems like it’ll be a relatively short cycle (April 16).)

*Solène, a 40-year-old single mom, begins an unexpected romance with 24-year-old Hayes Campbell, the lead singer of August Moon, the hottest boy band on the planet.*

It stars ***Anne Hathaway***, who is a known face and an excellent box office track record despite not appearing in many franchise IPs and ***Nicholas Galitzine*** who has been in several notable streaming hits such as *Cinderella*, *Purple Hearts*, and *Red, White &amp; Royal Blue.*

Both *Hathaway* and *Galitzine* have a considerable social media presence with the trailer for *The Idea of You* being the most watched ever for a streaming movie garnering over 125M impressions across social media platforms.

Now appearing in the same movie together and both the actors appealing to different generations, their mutual synergy could lead the movie to breakout among multiple demographics, including, but not restricted to both young and old females.

*The Idea of You* premiered at SXSW to favourable reactions with the movie currently standing at a strong **95%** *(19 reviews)* on RT and **77** *(9 reviews)* on Metacritic.

***HIT MAN***

*A mild-mannered college professor moonlights as an undercover police cop who also pretends to be a fake hitman for hire.*

*When a woman hires him to place a hit on her abusive husband, his life soon descends into a web of lies and conspiracies.*

***Glen Powell*** and ***Adria Arjona*** play the leads in the movie who share some brilliant electric chemistry, with *Powell* also adeptly switching in and out of his various disguises and mannerisms with the movie.

The movie also flips and bends through various genres with romance, comedy, action, thriller, and suspense being interminably wound together, with it being effectively described as, a screwball romcom noir that is also a faux Hitchcockian thriller.

It also plays extremely well with an audience with the movie being basically a certified laugh riot, with multiple twists and turns, *Hit Man* was always an audience magnet across the fall festival circuit last year spanning across oceans from Venice, Hamburg and London to Toronto, New York and Sundance.

The movie was also the costliest buy at *TIFF* last year in September when Netflix acquired the movie for a sum of **$20M** 

It will be released in cinemas in Canada and select US locations including Alamo Drafthouse and Regal chains, though I'm sure Powell's team would be kicking themselves after *Anyone But You*, which released in December of last year became a surprise sleeper hit.

*Hit Man* could have tried to replicate the same this year by being released in theatres during the Christmas corridor, as an R-rated romcom counter-programming, against the other December releases which are mainly PG and PG-13 live-action, hybrid and animated releases.

Already there has been word going around, ever since it first premiered last year in Venice, about it being a possible Oscar contender, with the movie already met with universal acclaim from critics with a **96%** *(78 reviews)* on RT and an **82** *(20 reviews)* on Metacritic.

***BEVERLY HILLS COP: AXEL F***

*Detective Axel Foley is back on the beat in Beverly Hills. After his daughter Jane’s life is threatened, she and Foley team up with a new partner and old pals Billy Rosewood and John Taggart to turn up the heat and uncover a conspiracy.*

If there is any other movie other than *Top Gun*, that is iconic and emblematic of the 80's, it is ***Beverly Hills Cop*** which released in 1984 became the highest grossing movie of the year as well as the sequel in 1987 which is the highest grossing of the series.

*Axel F* comes 30 years after the third installment while also celebrating the 40th anniversary of the franchise.

It is very grating to see that *Paramount* sent the movie directly to streaming on Netflix, especially when they are really struggling with their current theatrical output slate and the studio themselves saw with *Top Gun: Maverick* a couple of years ago, which also had the original star returning along with a bunch of new stars, something which is what *Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F* seems to be closely trying to replicate.

It is already the third most watched trailer for a streaming flick with audiences being curious to see *Eddie Murphy* return to his most iconic role after a wait of decades.",7,36

Here's a new edition of ""Directors at the Box Office"", which seeks to explore the directors' trajectory at the box office and analyze their hits and bombs. I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Todd Phillips' turn.

Phillips attended New York University Film School, but dropped out because he could not afford to complete his first film and pay tuition simultaneously. Around that time, he worked at Kim's Video and Music. He appeared as one of the drivers in the first season of the HBO hidden camera docu-series *Taxicab Confessions*. He made a great impression when he made a documentary film, *Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies*, which received a limited release despite being a student film. While at Sundance, Phillips met Ivan Reitman, who introduced him to the film industry.

From a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?

That's the point of this post. To analyze his career.

His directorial debut. The film stars Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Paulo Costanzo, Amy Smart, Rachel Blanchard, Fred Ward, DJ Qualls and Tom Green, and follows four college friends who embark on an 1,800-mile road trip to retrieve an illicit tape mistakenly mailed to a girlfriend.

The film received mixed reviews from critics, but it was a box office success, earning $119 million worldwide. It cemented Phillips as a reliable comedy director. After strong DVD sales, a direct sequel was purposed but mainly failed when producers could not come up with anything ""that would not easily become an *American Pie*."" Some of the purposed creative ideas would move on to become *Eurotrip*.

- **Budget:** $16,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $68,540,777.

- **Worldwide gross:** $119,754,278.

#**Old School (2003)**

*""All the fun of college. None of the education.""*

His second film. The film stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell and Jeremy Piven, and follows three depressed men in their thirties who seek to relive their college days by starting a fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so.

One of Phillips' documentaries, *Frat House*, involved fraternities. Ivan Reitman, who had produced *Animal House*, saw the documentary and wanted to collaborate with Phillips to revive the frat comedy film genre. The success of *Road Trip* prompted Phillips and co-writer Scot Armstrong to pitch Reitman on a fraternity-themed film centered around adult men instead of the usual college-aged kids. Said Armstrong, ""There's a weird brotherhood that happens when you're in college were you're kind of finding yourself, and it was funny to think of old people doing it.""

Like *Road Trip*, it received mixed reviews. And just like that film, it was also a box office success. Phillips was unstoppable.

- **Budget:** $24,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $75,585,093.

- **Worldwide gross:** $87,135,520.

#**Starsky &amp; Hutch (2004)**

*""They're the man.""*

His third film. Based on the 1970s TV series, it stars Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis and Snoop Dogg. It follows two streetwise undercover cops, David Starsky and Ken ""Hutch"" Hutchinson, in the fictional city of Bay City, California in 1975 who bust drug criminals with the help of underworld boss Huggy Bear.

It received a generally favorable response, with Stiller and Wilson receiving praise for their chemistry. Phillips found another hit as it passed $170 million worldwide, becoming his highest grossing film.

- **Budget:** $60,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $88,237,754.

- **Worldwide gross:** $170,268,750.

#**School for Scoundrels (2006)**

*""Too nice? Too honest? Too you? Help is on the way.""*

His fourth film. A remake of the 1960 film, it stars Billy Bob Thornton, Jon Heder, Jacinda Barrett, Luis Guzmán, David Cross, Horatio Sanz, Sarah Silverman and Michael Clarke Duncan. It follows a young man who joins a class to increase his self-confidence to win over the girl he is smitten with, but the situation becomes complicated when his teacher has the same agenda.

The film received negative reviews from critics, unfavorably comparing it to the original. It was also a box office bomb, failing to hit its production budget. To this day, it's his lowest grossing film.

- **Budget:** $35,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $17,807,569.

- **Worldwide gross:** $24,470,583.

#**The Hangover (2009)**

*""Some guys just can't handle Las Vegas.""*

His fifth film. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Heather Graham, Justin Bartha, Ken Jeong, and Jeffrey Tambor. It tells the story of Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, Alan Garner, and Doug Billings, who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party to celebrate Doug's impending marriage. However, Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up with Doug missing and no memory of the previous night's events, and must find the groom before the wedding can take place.

The plot was inspired by a real event that happened to Tripp Vinson, a producer and friend of executive producer Chris Bender. Vinson had gone missing from his own Las Vegas bachelor party, blacking out and waking up ""in a strip club being threatened with a very, very large bill I was supposed to pay"". Jon Lucas and Scott Moore sold a script in which three friends would lose the groom and try to find him. It was rewritten by Phillips, who added additional elements such as Mike Tyson and his tiger, the baby, and the police cruiser.

Stu's missing tooth was not created with prosthetics or visual effects, but is naturally occurring: Helms never had an adult incisor grow, and got a dental implant as a teenager, which was removed for filming. For the scene where Chow jumps naked over Phil, that wasn't on the script and was improvised with Phillips' blessing (he also had to ask his wife to appear naked).

The film surpassed the wildest expectations at the box office. It opened with $44 million in its first weekend, and didn't drop higher than 37% until its 20th weekend. The film closed with a colossal $277.3 million domestically, passing *Beverly Hills Cop* as the highest grossing R-rated comedy (unadjusted). Worldwide, it made $469 million worldwide, becoming 2009's tenth highest grossing film. It received a favorable response, and it even won the Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. Phillips bounced back and was stronger than ever. 

- **Budget:** $35,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $277,339,746.

- **Worldwide gross:** $469,328,922.

#**Due Date (2010)**

*""Leave your comfort zone.""*

His sixth film. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Juliette Lewis, and Jamie Foxx. The film follows a man who must get across the country to Los Angeles in time for the birth of his child and is forced to road-trip with an aspiring actor. 

Despite mixed reviews, the audience was very interested in Phillips' follow-up to *The Hangover* and seeing Iron Man in a raunchy comedy. It earned $211 million worldwide, marking another success for Phillips.

- **Budget:** $65,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $100,539,043.

- **Worldwide gross:** $211,780,824.

#**The Hangover Part II (2011)**

*""The wolfpack is back.""*

His seventh film. The sequel to *The Hangover*, it stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jeffrey Tambor, Justin Bartha, and Paul Giamatti. It tells the story of Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug, as they travel to Thailand. After the bachelor party in Las Vegas, Stu takes no chances and opts for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. Things do not go as planned, resulting in another bad hangover with no memories of the previous night.

Two months before the original opened, WB commissioned Phillips to develop a sequel after the very positive test screenings. The writers, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, chose not to return as they felt their story was over. So Phillips co-wrote the script with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong. They decided to follow the same structure as the original. Mel Gibson was announced to cameo as a Bangkok tattoo artist, but this was canned by Phillips and WB when crew members opposed to his presence. Cooper then invited Liam Neeson, whom he worked with in *The A-Team*, to play the artist. While Neeson filmed the scene, Phillips had to reshoot the scene later on as he cut the scene that immediately followed Neeson's cameo, meaning it no longer had the information necessary to logically get the main characters to the situation in the next scene. As Neeson was unavailable, he replaced him with Nick Cassavetes.

The film broke many box office records. It earned $10 million in midnight previews, which was the highest for an R-rated film. Its opening day was $31.6 million, almost doubling the original's opening day. It opened with $85 million ($135 million over its first five days). While it was heavily anticipated, it didn't have the original's legs; it fell harder and it finished with $254 million domestically, below the original. But worldwide, the film was bigger; it made a huge $586 million worldwide, becoming the highest grossing R-rated comedy worldwide (a record it still keeps). While the original was well received, the sequel was panned, mainly for its derivative nature.

- **Budget:** $80,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $254,464,305.

- **Worldwide gross:** $586,764,305.

#**The Hangover Part III (2013)**

*""The end.""*

His eighth film. The third and final installment in *The Hangover* trilogy, it stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham, Mike Epps, Melissa McCarthy, Justin Bartha, and John Goodman. The film follows the ""Wolfpack"" as they try to get Alan the help he needs after facing a personal crisis, after the bachelor party in Bangkok. However, things go awry when an incident from the original film comes back to haunt them.

Before the second film opened, Phillips was already planning on a third film. Despite not having a script, he had an idea where the film would serve as the finale and it would follow a different structure. Craig Mazin returned to co-write the film with Phillips, with the setting confirmed to be in Tijuana.

The film was panned by critics, criticizing it for its unfunny script and deemed as the worst in the franchise. And it looks like the franchise hit its diminishing returns, as the film saw a big drop compared to the past films. It earned just $112 million domestically and $362 million worldwide. Profitable, but a big drop. While the stars are open in returning, Philips is not interested in another film.

- **Budget:** $103,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $112,200,072.

- **Worldwide gross:** $362,000,072.

#**War Dogs (2016)**

*""Hustling their way to the American Dream.""*

His ninth film. The film is based on the book *Arms and the Dudes* by Guy Lawson, and stars Miles Teller, Jonah Hill, Ana de Armas and Bradley Cooper. The film follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a U.S. Army contract to supply ammunitions for the Afghan National Army worth approximately $300 million.

The film received mixed reviews from critics for its tone and script. And the film seemed to suggest that Phillips was losing his touch, as the film failed to double its budget.

- **Budget:** $50,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $43,034,523.

- **Worldwide gross:** $86,434,523.

#**Joker (2019)**

*""Put on a happy face.""*

His tenth film. Loosely based on the DC Comics character, it stars Joaquin Phoenix as the title character, with supporting performances from Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz and Frances Conroy. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed clown and aspiring stand-up comedian whose descent into mental illness and nihilism inspires a violent countercultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying Gotham City.

For years, Phillips was offered to direct comic book films, but he always rejected them as he deemed them ""loud"" and because he was just not interested. However, he was interested in a grounded take on the genre. He was attracted to the Joker because he did not think there was a definitive portrayal of the character, which he knew would provide considerable creative freedom. After the poor reception to his past comedy films, he claimed that it was difficult to make comedy films in the ""woke culture"", throughout opposition of ""30 million people on Twitter"".

Phillips convinced Warner Bros. in investing in low-budget stand-alone comic book films. The idea was for a Joker film, with Martin Scorsese producing and Phillips directing from a script written by himself and Scott Silver. Scorsese considered directing the film before Phillips was chosen, though a Warner Bros. source said he only became involved because the film needed a New York City-based producer. Scorsese was scheduled to produce, although he would later say he would just executive produce, before simply leaving the project to focus on *The Irishman*.

WB wanted Leonardo DiCaprio for the role, but Phillips was only interested in Joaquin Phoenix. Phoenix had previously declined to act in the Marvel Cinematic Universe because he would have been required to reprise a role, such as the Hulk or Doctor Strange, in multiple films. However, he was interested if the role would be a stand-alone grounded take. Phoenix said when he learned of the film, he became excited because it was the kind he was looking to make, describing it as unique and stating it did not feel like a typical ""studio movie"".

The film was inspired by other films like *Taxi Driver*, *Raging Bull*, *The King of Comedy*, *Serpico*, *One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest*, *The Man Who Laughs* and even Phillips' own *Hangover* trilogy. The film was not based or inspired by any specific comic book, but Phillips and Silver simply took some elements they liked from the character's history. Phillips said that while the script's themes may reflect modern society, the film was not intended to be political, and that the main focus was child trauma and mental illness.

While the film was undergoing scripting, DC was going through a rough phase. *Batman v Superman* made money but it received negative reception and earned far less than expected, and *Justice League* had just bombed. Walter Hamada was appointed as the head of DC and he started a restructuring. WB was reluctant to let *Joker* move forward and gave it a small budget in an effort to dissuade Phillips. Phillips said that Hamada did not understand what he was trying to do. After Phoenix officially signed, WB greenlit it and filming was allowed to commence, and Bradley Cooper joined the film as a producer. Despite greenlighting, Phillips decided to defer his upfront salary on the film in exchange for a greater percentage of the adjusted gross, which reportedly included between 10% and 13% on the backend.

Phillips rewrote the entire script during filming; and because Phoenix lost so much weight for the film, there would not be an opportunity for reshoots. Phillips recalled Phoenix sometimes walked off-set during filming because he lost self-control and needed to compose himself — to the confusion of other actors, who felt they had done something wrong. De Niro was one of the few Phoenix never walked out on and De Niro said he was ""very intense in what he was doing, as it should be, as he should be"".

The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival. In a surprising move, it won the Golden Lion, the festival's highest honor. When it premiered in theaters, it was insanely hyped by the audience and it didn't disappoint in the slightest.

It opened with a huge $96 million in its first weekend, eclipsing the October weekend record and the fourth biggest debut for an R-rated film. Comic book films were often front-loaded, yet *Joker* wasn't that case. It dipped just 41% and added $55.9 million. It didn't see a drop higher than 50% until its 11th weekend. Domestically, it closed with an extraordinary $335 million, becoming the fourth biggest R-rated film in the market. 

But the story didn't just stop there. If it had an incredible run domestically, then what's the word to describe its even bigger performance overseas? In its first weekend, it opened with a colossal $234 million worldwide, breaking more box office records. Eventually, it passed *Deadpool* to become the highest grossing R-rated worldwide. And then, on November 15, it became the first R-rated to cross the $1 billion milestone. A colossal success, especially compared to its small budget. But the real winner was Phillips; through his backend deal, he earned up to $100 million for the film.

Critics were divided on the film. Some praised the screenplay, musical score, cinematography and Phoenix's performance, while others were divided on Phillips' directing, dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and lack of originality. But there was a lot of support in the industry, with many proclaiming it as a masterpiece. Phillips himself questioned his critics, ""Isn't it good to have these discussions about these movies, about violence? Why is that a bad thing if the movie does lead to a discourse about it? What's outstanding to me in this discourse in this movie is how easily the far left can sound like the far right when it suits their agenda. It's really been eye-opening for me.""

And its success didn't stop at the box office. *Joker* was a big player during awards season. It received a leading 11 nominations at the Oscars, breaking the record set by *The Dark Knight* for most nominations for a comic book film. These nominations included Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay, earning Phillips 3 nominations. It ended up winning two awards: Best Original Score and Best Actor for Phoenix, making the character one of the few to win two acting Oscars for different actors.

We won't say Phillips got his big break here, because he was already a massively successful director at the box office. But this was definitely his most memorable and important film to date.

- **Budget:** $70,000,000.

- **Domestic gross:** $335,477,657.

- **Worldwide gross:** $1,078,958,629.

#**The Future**

He's currently in post-production for *Joker: Folie à Deux*. While originally saying he didn't want sequels to *Joker*, he changed his mind. Phoenix will return, and will be joined by Lady Gaga in the role of Harley Quinn. Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener were also cast. The film will be ""a musical with up to 15 songs"" and will carry a $200 million budget, far bigger than the original.

#**Other Projects**

Phillips has produced films like *All the King's Men*, *Project X* and *A Star Is Born*.

He co-wrote and was scheduled to direct *Borat*. After filming the rodeo scene, Phillips subsequently left the film as he often clashed with Sacha Baron Cohen, and was replaced by Larry Charles. Despite that, he's still credited with a ""story by"" credit. This allowed him to get his first Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, losing to *The Departed*.

#**The Verdict**

Insanely reliable.

When comedies were the thing at the movies, Phillips knew how to attract audiences. Some are still popular to this day. But even with the decline of comedies, he decided to make a new impression with small-scale comic book films and he left a big mark. And of course, credit has to go to him; he fought for every aspect and no one tried to make something like this on a comic book film. Even though his films can be raunchy and juvenile at times, Phillips has proved to be a very smart filmmaker. We don't know if he or Judd Apatow can resurrect the comedy genre, but he can easily evolve into something else and leave a big impression.

The next director will be **John Carpenter**. A cult filmmaker that didn't get the recognition he deserved at the time.

I asked you to choose who else should be in the run and the comment with the most upvotes would be chosen. Well, we'll later talk about... &gt;!Clint Eastwood.!&lt; An iconic actor and an iconic director.

This is the schedule for the following four:

April 22-28 | John Carpenter | Is that really it? No more films?
April 29-May 5 | Danny Boyle | It was a long wait, but *28 Years Later* is finally happening.
May 6-12 | Wes Craven | A horror legend.
May 13-19 | Clint Eastwood | Great actor. Great director.

The film had a reported budget of somewhere between  $365M-$495M. Deadline says $250M production cost. I'm not sure if an exact number has ever been given. The film would go onto gross $1.4B globally vs the first movies $1.5B. Should Disney be disappointed with this? It almost matched the first film. Albeit likely on a bigger budget than the first film so it their take-home proffit was probably less. 

Prior to the film entering production the franchises leading man at the time RDJ entered a very publicised pay dispute with Disney over his reported payday for Avengers 2 and subsequently Avengers 3 and 4. Downey would later settle this dispute and go on to be paid $35M for Avengers 2. With the condition his fellow cast members were also fairly compensated. With $35M going to towards Downey alone. And probably north of $50M just for the cast.

According to deadline the studio net profit for the film was $382M so not anything terrible. But maybe less than what they were hoping given the initial investment in production and the cost of the cast. One can kinda see why Disney *might* in theory be disappointed. But when you consider the world building it does and essentially cemented Avengers as the defacto summer blockbuster IP of the time and set the stage for subsequent MCU films being the box office behemoths they were. Civil War, Infinity War, Endgame etc it paid off in spades in the long run. Simply put, Disney owes much of the MCUs later successes to Age of Ultron. And should not be disappointed with its results.

I was a Family Guy watcher, but the show had started to decline in both quality and viewership after season 8, and Ted came around season 11/12 of production, so it's not like it was capitalizing off of the show's prime.

Even if it had, I don't see how that would translate to success for the film due to it being an entirely different IP. Yeah MacFarlane was reusing Peter's voice and Mila Kunis was in the flick, but that's stretching the comparisons and Mark Wahlberg was far from a big box office draw.

Yet it made over half a billion at the box office and got Seth enough clout to make more original stuff. Why was that?",62,0

We're up to 44 participants and I'm overjoyed at the enagement I've gotten. There's still time left to get involved and I'll be closing the poll soon. 

For those who still want to join, I just want to say because I've had to message several about this: **DO NOT LEAVE THE BACKUP FILM BLANK**. I don't care if you don't have one off the top of your head, it's mandatory in order for everyone to be on a fair playing field and if one films gets delayed to out of the summer season and you don't have a backup, you will only have 9 films and thus have less of a chance to get points.

Also: ***Please do not list Horizon: An American Saga*** in seperate movies. Do not put Chapter One beside it. As I said earlier and in the poll, we are taking both films gross culmulatively just so we avoid any confusion.

Follow the form to join the game: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0JK2LpkuMU1W-5POg16HnISiOwZWif-z57kZRPCw5biGj9g/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf0JK2LpkuMU1W-5POg16HnISiOwZWif-z57kZRPCw5biGj9g/viewform?usp=sf_link)

**SYNOPSIS:**

Based upon recently declassified files of the British War Department and inspired by true events, THE MINISTRY OF UNGENTLEMANLY WARFARE is an action-comedy that tells the story of the first-ever special forces organization formed during WWII by UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and a small group of military officials including author Ian Fleming. The top-secret combat unit, composed of a motley crew of rogues and mavericks, goes on a daring mission against the Nazis using entirely unconventional and utterly “ungentlemanly” fighting techniques. Ultimately their audacious approach changed the course of the war and laid the foundation for the British SAS and modern Black Ops warfare.

The sequels, ***Fifty Shades Darker*** and ***Fifty Shades Freed***, contingent upon the success of the first installment were subsequently greenlit.

Originally supposed to come out the following year in 2016, both the movies were shot concurrently for a combined budget of *$110M*, and were released in consecutive years in Feb of 2017 and 2018, grossing **$381M** and **$372M** worldwide.

The *Fifty Shades* series, *which follows a naive inexperienced woman in a romantic relationship with an handsome CEO of a Forbes 500 company, with the additional hook of BDSM as the mysterious X-factor beneath everything*, powered its way to a combined haul of **$1.323B** worldwide with a total budget of *$150M* across the trilogy.

That yields an avg multiplier of almost *9x* through the franchise, something which was originally conceived as *Twilight* fan-fiction.

*Darker* and *Freed* grossing within $10M of each other means the portion of the audience, which came back for the second one also turned up for the final adventure, a figure which comes to approximately 60% of the first installment.

The learnings that could be taken from the *Fifty Shades* series, which leans into the erotic thriller romance genre, succeeded in bringing out the women and especially older women, often an underserved demographic.

And yet there haven't been any serious attempts by studios to revive the genre in all these subsequent years for the big screen theatrical experience.

Streaming giant Netflix did try its hand with the *Polish* ***365 Days*** series, following the exact same template as *Fifty Shades*, with the first part reportedly being successful enough as to greenlight two sequels.

The pandemic also considerably complicated matters with studios being cautious in how to navigate the changed theatrical marketplace along with the simultaneous boom in streaming media.

Among these are *Sydney Sweeney's* ***The Voyeurs***, an erotic thriller, whose performance greatly exceeded Amazon's expectations at the streamer's home, Prime Video.

*Ana de Armas'* ***Deep Water*** which forewent a theatrical release in favor of going directly to streaming at Hulu and Amazon Prime and last year's ***Sharper*** at Apple TV+ after a one week limited theatrical run by A24 are some other very few examples of the genre.

Among other stuff, the staples of 80's erotic thrillers, ***American Gigolo*** and ***Fatal Attraction***, were both revived for a new generation but in the form of a limited series at *Showtime* and *Paramount+* respectively.

Which actually seems to be insane as studios have just completely abandoned the genre for cinemas, since we just saw with the success of ***Anyone But You***, an R-rated raunchy romcom drama, grossing around **$220M** worldwide making almost 9x its budget of *$25M*.

It also doesn't make sense that these movies can be shot quickly and cheaply at mostly one location, like the aforementioned *Anyone But You* which was shot at mostly Sydney in Mar-Apr 2023 and had no trailers or posters or marketing of any kind just before two months ahead of release in Dec 2023.

And as we are seeing the rapid decline of small-to-mid budget feature films, with studios being heavily overreliant on their big-budget action tentpoles, making for a very lopsided top heavy theatrical box office, where the risk increases proportionally to reward with every increase in budget, in stark contrast to these smaller scale films, which have huge upsides to low downsides.",16,39

While not terrible, it doesn't exactly bode well for the movie's $28M budget barring good WOM. This also marks the third vampire themed movie from Universal to underperform.

So, that begs the question: Are vampire movies box office poison? Outside of maybe Twilight (if you want to count that), when was the last time the genre had a sizeable hit? 

I was curious to hear everyone else's thoughts on this.",230,359

###**The Boy and the Heron**

The Boy and The Heron hits ¥699.5M/$96.70M after adding another $1.17M today. On the verge of crossing ¥700M. Its now fallen behind Suzume for the first time since release.

https://i.imgur.com/FvkEpSC.png

Weekend projections upgraded to $5.9M(-53%)

**Audience Figures:**

Scores: Maoyan: 8.8   , Taopiaopiao: 9.4      , Douban: 7.7

The Boy and The Heron's gender split has narrowed a bit through the last few days going from an initial 44-56% lean towards women to a 47-53% split still favoring women. Women still appear to like the movie more with an on average 0.2-0.3 higher rating given to the movie.

The movie unsurprisingly sways towards younger audiences with the 20-24 bracket being the most popular. Younger audiences have also given the movie the best score with the average rating of the 20 and under bracket being 9.8.

###**Godzilla X Kong:**

Godzilla X Kong hits ¥821M/$113.67M. Keeps distancing itself from Meg 2 but falling behind Dominions summer run at this point.

https://i.imgur.com/2Fgv16C.png

It has been extended through May and will therefore play through the May Day Holidays although given the large ammount of new releases its probably best not to expect too much from that period.

Weekend projections upgraded to $6.7M(-34%)

**Audience Figures:**

Scores: Maoyan: 9.4   , Taopiaopiao: 9.5      , Douban: 6.8

GxK's gender split however has not changed in the last few days remaining very male skewed with a 65-35 split. Women remain more forgiving to the movie with a high 9.6 average rating versus 9.4 for the men on Taopiaopiao.

Audiences skew older than for The Boy and The Heron with the 25-29 bracket being the most popular.

#**Other stuff:**


The next holywood releases currently scheduled are Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes on May 10th and The Fall Guy on May 17th.

Some rumors suggest Garfield could release around Childers Day which.

On The Japanese front Digimon Adventure 02: The Beginning releases on the 20th followed by  another Miyazaki movie Howl's Moving Castle on the 30th April alongside SPYxFAMILY CODE: White which will release on the same day.

Doraemon 43 has now been confirmed for May 31st release which was expected as its right on the verge of Children's Day on June 1st.

Haikyu!! The Movie: Decisive Battle at the Garbage Dump will release on the 15th June.

Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom will also release in China sometimes in May.

So loads of Japanese content ariving to China in the next few months.

---

#**May(Labour) Day Slate:**

With May 1st fast approaching the Holiday release slate has mostly formed. The 5 day holiday will see 10 new movies release. 2 Japanese animations, 2 local animations and 6 live action movies. 

While this is one of the bigger Holiday periods of the year its traditionaly not a strong movie going period which means all of the biggest blockbusters mostly avoid it. There's only 3 movies from the Labor Day Holiday periods in the top 100 of all time list by gross with the highest being Us and Them in 71st with a gross of $215M 

Most of the movies have started pre-sales in the last few days with a few still left to start . 3 Animations will strike first on Aprill 30th including both of the Japanese ones. And then the rest will follow on the 1st.

I'l have a more detailed writeup about the movies a bit closer to release.

Spy X Family continues to outpace Howl's Moving Castle in the battle of the Japanese animations. On the live action front Formed Police Unit still easily leading pre-sales and should pass $1M in opening day pre-sales over the weekend.

*Warner Bros. Pictures'* ***Trap***

*Lionsgate's* ***Borderlands***

*Sony's* ***It Ends With Us***

*Amazon MGM's* ***The Fire Inside***

*Neon's* ***Cuckoo***

*Roadside Attractions'* ***My Penguin Friend***

*Metrograph Pictures'* ***Good One***

Someone has to move or there might be a few casualties.

***Borderlands*** is sent out to die by *Lionsgate* which will likely be highly fan-driven opening weekend before legs completely collapsing thereafter like ***Five Nights at Freddy's*** so the release date probably doesn't matter.

***It Ends With Us*** is a good counter-programming as a romcom against horror features ***Trap*** and ***Cuckoo*** which I guess both can reasonably co-exist together with *Trap* being more horror adjacent and *Cuckoo* has already shifted it's release date once so it will stay.

***Good One*** and ***The Penguin Friend*** are getting nationwide releases with little to no marketing so can't hope for much.

Maybe boxing drama ***The Fire Inside*** (earlier *Flint Strong*) moves to the fall for an awards release campaign.",42,128

- ThatWaluigiDude (I can say that the pre-sales for Planet of the Apes keep growing and are looking pretty decent for a movie still pretty far off, it is safe to say that movie already have Brazil locked on (April 16). Planet of the Apes have opened the pre-sales, first 24 hours have sold 1/3 from the first day of Dune 2. However, Apes opened pre-sales more than two weeks and a half before Dune 2 opened their's. So this is good for Apes, solid start (April 11).)

- ThatWaluigiDude (Civil War's marketing is the most expensive ever from Diamond Films, A24's distributor in the country. It's really strong and its been treated as a big blockbuster.)

I think I'll like camera acting better than live theater because I can order a retake if anyone makes an onscreen mistake.

But would you rather act on camera or a live theater in front of a live audience?

I'd never want to act in front of an audience and only let an audience see the final filmed product after all the imperfections are edited away.

By the way, if anyone knows of any camera acting gig near Hutch, KS, I'll see about signing up. I think I have a butt-ton of untapped film acting potential in me.",5,0

&amp;#x200B;

The visual effects for Babylon 5's pilot movie were provided by a studio named Foundation Imaging, using a series of Commodore Amiga computers and NewTek's Video Toaster technology.  For their work on the pilot, Foundation Imaging won the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement In Special Visual Effects.

&amp;#x200B;

In these brief recent videos, two of the show's principal actors give their impressions of the revolutionary technology.

That's not to say the movies arent completely bombing and dogshit

But the marvels (270m)  had a budget more then double what it cost to make Oppenheimer (100m). And almost 100 million more then dune part 2 (170m). 

Alot of the difference is probably cgi, but they could certainly just make sets if cgi is costing that much. But even comparing it to other cgi heavy films leaves you scratching your head

The highest estimated budget for avatar 2 was 400 million, but its literally twice the film. With almost an hour and a half more runtime (1 hour 45 for the marvels) and cgi quality so good people believed some shots were live action. 

I mean thor love and thunder had a budget of 250 million, with a similarly pathetic 1 hour and 59 minute runtime. And that film had some of the worst cgi ever.

She hulk had a budget of 225 million, meaning it somehow cost more then game of thrones season 7 and 8 combined.
And 25 million more then house of the dragon season 1, which has double the runtime.

Disney budgets just dont make sense and I suspect its hollywood accounting; with an exec pocketing 25 - 50 million every project.

While I enjoyed some aspects of it, the ending was awful. I also thought season 2 wasn’t that bad and really, really enjoyed season 3.

I'm working on my graduation project for my master's design course and I've decided to develope a display typeface. Earlier I was straight up going for inspiration derived from Abbas Kiarostami, the legendary Iranian filmmaker, and provide the typeface the characteristics derived from his filmmaking style and approach. For example, how he depicts contrast between life and hope, works on the separation and amalgamation of truth &amp; fiction, uses reconciliation b/w tradition, uses disruptive style of naration etc. translating to contrast heavy, serif display typeface with modern connotations. But it would just come off as an experimental way of learning the type design discipline and would not necessarily solve any problem and work towards any gap that is not realised yet or worked upon.
With context to cinema, typography has been a mostly ignored part of its entirety and is used for opening credits, title and post credits description. Some attempts have been made by early designers like Saul Bass, Dan Perri, Pablo Ferro, Maurice Binder etc. to make the opening credits speak for the movie before the audience gets into the film but all their work was addressed on a custom requirement, setup up by the filmmakers. Every film would need a different style of typography and a typeface designed with a general idea would not work for all or even a specific section of it. 
I'd request for help and suggestions which can help me identify a need in this related domain that can be solved by a newer refreshing typeface. All kind of suggestions are welcome and as we say in design, no question or idea is stupid. ",0,1

I went to a cinema in Florida in around 2008 and watched Valkyrie, and even with a film of darker subject matter, the audience then were cheering and clapping as the credits rolled. Though this matters less, of course. 

Why is this a thing? Surely you're missing vital dialogue, meaningful exposition etc. by disrupting yourself and those around you with displays of manic enthuse? I understand that for some, it is part of the atmospheric experience. But it isn't a concert. It wouldn't matter if it were mere music. But to scream so loudly that dialogue is practically incomprehensible, what is the point?

If youngsters so much as chuckle too loudly during a UK screening, whilst messing around with friends, they're often reported and asked to leave - and rightfully so. Different if it were a comedy and the point is to laugh, obviously... ",67,21

Hey,

I love psychological movies. But often when i say that, people advice me to see Sevens, or the Fifth Elements, like thriller.

But this is not what i meant.

Today i have one move and there is one police interrogation and i love the tension, the dialogue in this interrogation. It doesn't mean necessary to be a thriller. I like when it looks like realistic and when there is no music.

I love for example https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview_(1998_film) with Hugo Weaving.

But I don't like The Silence of the Lambs.

I don't like when the motivation is to scare.

I prefer when the personalities are clever, they have strategies, and they use psychological triggers.

Do you have any advice ?",10,7

2)I expected a war movie, not some sort of analysis of war photography. Although I thought it was interesting they were definitely more adrenaline junkies than truth informers (why they did not photograph the racist red glasses dude)

3) I expected more conflict between characters about who is “right” in the civil war

I understand the intention of the director was to be apolitical and leave that out…hence the California and Texas Allies thing…and that’s fine. That is a good idea to not go “republican bad” or whatever.

 But at least invent some other conflict or something? Or at least show some fancy military equipment? 

I also think Reddit is filled with bots or people not watching the movie…if you saw the movie and walked out thinking it was garbage, please validate me 🙏🏿

Hi everyone, for an assignment I quickly talk about what an  anamorphic lens is but my teacher told me that my explanation was not  clear... I don't understand what's wrong, thanks in advance!   

**""These so-called ""anamorphic"" lenses are lenses with strong  distortion caused by an anamorphic prism which concentrates the light  rays at a focal point in order to then deflect them.** *Unlike  a ""fish-eye"" lens which also distorts the scene, the lenses Anamorphics  maintain the vertical lines perfectly straight but on the other hand  stretch the horizontal lines of the image.* 

*Thus the captured image ends up being larger and we obtain an aspect ratio which is generally 2.39:1 or 2.35:1""* ",3,0

Just watched The Stepford Wives (1975) version, and I thought it was brilliant. Terrifying and brilliant.

My one question is: are the children turned into robots, too?? Here is my reasoning that points to “Yes”.

1) In the scene when Joanna’s kids get on the bus, the children all seem to be quite lifeless, and robotic.

2) Joanna, near the end, has no idea where her kids are and assumed they’d be with Bobbie, but they weren’t. Dis says they’re with Charmaine, but Charmaine is a robot now and after seeing what Ava’s Robot did to her, it might make sense that Charmaine unalived them. Which is terrifying.

3) The recording that says “mommy” over and over again is clearly a recording of her child. Why would they need a recording of the child if they weren’t going to “Stepford” them.

I know they later came out with a movie called the “Stepford Children” but still doesn’t account for the three points above.

Please note, I’m talking about the movie and not the book, but I plan on reading it!

sono un ragazzo di 22 anni interessato al mondo del cinema; ho una buona cultura in merito ma fino a questo momento mi sono molto concentrato circa la recitazione e il doppiaggio.

Voglio però tentare la fortuna, e mi interesserebbe capire una cosa: vorrei affiancare al mio percorso uno più autoriale: sceneggiatura o regia.  
Circa la prima, scrivo abbastanza bene, però racconti, che so benissimo essere molto diversi da troppi punti di vista alle sceneggiature (ritmo, tempi, modalità di scrittura) e regia (di cui sono totalmente neofita ma appunto mi interesserebbe capire come riuscire ad imparare qualcosa non avendo neanche un attrezzo se non il mio piccolo bagaglio culturale derivante dai film che ho visto).

Quindi le mie domande sono:  
1) Dove studiare per imparare? (non mi rispondete con csc per favore che non ci entrano neanche ragazzi con esperienza decennale, magari consigliatemi qualche accademia base con cui iniziare un percorso per imparare e poi magari maturata la mia esperienza proverò lì). Per esempio, io ho saputo che la Roma Film Academy non sia malaccio, mentre mi è stata molto sconsigliata la RUFA. Pensavo bene anche della Griffith ma anche lì non ho trovato ste grandi recensioni.  
2) Su quale delle due focalizzarmi? Io prima di cimentarmi in questo mondo ero spaventato dalla tecnicità della regia (non conosco niente relativo alla tecnica di montaggio, fotografia...) ma col tempo ho imparato che paradossalmente il regista serve più ad avere una visione d'insieme che ad avere un occhio effettivamente ""tecnico"", e questo mi ha molto rasserenato

This makes a certain amount of sense, since it was needed to sort of set up the premise and how the characters related to each other, but I can imagine some audience members expecting it to come back, at least at the end.

I am trying to think if I have seen this before in any other movie.  I know there are movies with framing devices, but then the narration comes back in the end (and often periodically throughout).  Or you might have a very short ""Once upon a time"" type deal, but not from the protagonist's perspective, and this also will often come back in the end.  Even if it doesn't, it's not as extensive as this opening narration is.  Maybe this is more common than I'm remembering, as I hadn't really recalled that it even happened in this movie until this, probably my fourth or fifth rewatch.",0,1

4, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2 

The 4th film has absolutely nothing to offer. It doesn’t even feel like a Terminator movie. The story, cinematography, and casting is completely off. Even the soundtrack is awful. The 5th installment with idea of John becoming a Terminator is interesting if not a very flawed execution. It’s clearly a cash grab but has some redeeming scenes at the very least. The 6th was at decent entry at something new and did bring back a badass (but aged) Sarah Connor. The 3rd film is probably the most divisible. Arnold still in his later prime year but the film largely suffers from the time it debuted with unnecessary comic relief. Obviously the debate between the 1st or 2nd film comes down to personal preference. Both are nearly perfect films. The original has more of a thriller horror feel, with the sequel taking on a larger than life blockbuster appeal. Overall, I think the majority of the films are re-watcheable with the exception of the 4th film which personally has absolutely nothing to offer. Thoughts?",0,1

Hi all, 

So, idk if this is a right place to post this, I'm serious about this post and I'm giving it a shot. 

I'm a 23 yo movie buff and I've been thinking about starting a movie discussion group consisting of members from around the world. 

I know this subreddit is exclusively for this purpose, but I envision some thing that is a little more instant, active and where members can actually throw in their perspectives, ideas and reviews on a much more frequent basis, let's say for example, as in a Telegram/WhatsApp group chat. 

Now, this has to be a serious platform, I mean we should discuss movies and not be a lurker. My idea is to bring different views from around the world regarding the films we watch and also bring in topics in cinema or ideas that you have regarding filmmaking or let's say, you introduce the film industry of your own nation and things you like about it. 

I'm an aspiring filmmaker and writer, so I would like to learn a lot from the perspectives of others on various topics. I would also like to create a team of film lovers or those who are ready to work together in some distant future or meet up for events related to filmmaking, somewhere in the world. 

I'm pretty much into art house, indie and experimental films, but that's not a ""must"" for me, I love watching and talking about all kinds of movies. 

So, if you're interested in creating and being in such a group, kindly get in touch! ",1,5

Spring is the ideal time to reflect on our lives, leaving behind what has passed and looking forward with optimism and determination.

The season that invites us to renew our goals, cultivate new passions and make decisions that bring us closer to our best version.

Time to embrace change, to grow and to blossom.

The moment that promises wonder and hope and reminds us to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us, to embrace the opportunities that present themselves and to be inspired by vitality.

Desire to go back up, to make our way on our life path.

I don't know if I'm on the right track here, but I feel like we may see some sort of fusion between big-screen movies and mini-series in the near-ish future.

Dune 1 &amp; 2 were awesome in their own way, but after watching Shōgun, I'm so appreciative that they're taking the time to develop the story and the characters. That's just two examples, but there are *so* many stories (adaptations or new material) that would fantastic with 8-14 hours worth of screen time!

With the evolution of streaming and the increased capabilities of CGI, I could imagine something like Dune or Shōgun spread over a 3 episode 'Season 1' with a season finale that's basically a movie/theatrical release and then the same thing for 'Season 2' + series finale.

I  thought this would be one of the best screens around, and just wondering why their flagship screen isn't that good? Am I missing something? Was it because we watched the 70mm version (which I thought should be better if anything)?

My finance and I had the exact same impression when we came out of part 1, so went into part 2 a little apprehensive.

We go the cinema, at least, 3 times a month and watch all genres and types of movies but have never experienced anything anywhere near as loud as either of the two Dune movies.

Does anyone know if cinemas are instructed to screen movies with settings by the production company or distributor?  

I get that it’s a spectacle movie and it’s shot and scored for maximum impact,  but this was just distracting.

TLDR:  Both Dune movies have been the loudest cinema screenings I’ve ever been to, question in title.

So I'm curious would it be possible to do this at a regular movie theater? Like can I personally pay them to search up some old reel and let me watch a private show with me and my friends alone and nobody else of a movie of our choice? Or even in this digital age to bring my copy of a DVD or Blu-Ray copy of said movie or even a  USB stick containing the film and have them use the projector attached to modern devices to screen it?

How much would this typically cost if this is actually a practised done by movie theaters?

I love the atmosphere, the experience, and crowd when going to a local theater. 

I have been reading some people's opinion about why they don't like going to the theater what I noticed I agree with most of their reasons (price, annoying crowd, sticky floors with food lying around everyhing etc.) but I think most of the reasons usually applies in large Multiplexes or Cineplex. I live in Germany so this is the equivalent to Cinestar, Cinema X, UCI Kinowelt and, in the US it would be AMC. 

In most cases watching a movie in these kinds of cinemas are my very last resort (only when the movie is only shows in these theaters) and most cases I prefer going to local movie theater, a historical one, Indi, Arthouse, or a small cafe theater. The experience is usually more ""homey charm"" and special with the a less generic vibe to it. 

Examples I've been to in Berlin are B-Ware Kino, Babylon, Kino International, Passage Kino etc. And I spent some days in Seattle and had a good experience with SIFF Cinema Uptown. 

These are places that really make you feel like you watching movies in the way they are supposed to. You just don't get that feeling in the larger chains. 

And I do feel the crowd is much better in these in these theaters. I saw The Little Mermaid in one of these theaters (no kids) and the crowd was great, I'd imagine the larger chains would have more children watching. 

I also remember watching Spider-Man No Way Home twice. One in smaller theater and I had a good time the next was in a larger chain and there were a bunch of annoying teenagers making a ruckus the whole time. I guess this particular example is an extreme case but my point still stands. 

Not sure if any of you feel this way.

The evening prior I watched the 2022 live-action version (merely a bastardization of the objectively superior 1940 effort) and while it isn't utter trash, neither is it anything special or worth talking about. Having just viewed the 2022 iteration I wasn't particularly in the mood for 1940 as I started to watch it...
Yet the moment Jiminey appeared on screen I was instantly elated through the entirety of the film; Cliff Edwards' inflection and delivery of Jiminey's dialogue may be my favorite of any Disney character. There's a constant musicality woven throughout even seemingly insignificant moments in the film (the 2022 iteration is nearly void of that) and this is an aspect of extreme importance as to why I enjoy the film so much. The quality, fluidity and expressiveness of the animation combined with impeccable background paintings is stunning, it's deeply impressive how charming and polished this now 84 year old piece of animation remains.",1,0

For the cinema, only little projects the first year (in groups, with themes like emotions) and one big the second. We'll see how the cameras, lights and everything works. We'll also see movies and series and discuss how they dis things like the tension, why something happend etc...

Hope this message gets met with enthusiasm, even though it's a bit weird...  


I *love* movies but hate how the streaming industry has become super fragmented.  


I also noticed that the quality of movies has drastically decreased (have you noticed the same thing?).  Maybe I'm the only one?!  


Anyway, because of this, I cancelled all of my streaming services a while back and signed up for...Netflix DVD!!! (Yeah, I know, blast from the past)  


That is, until they shut it down (which happened last September).  


I know this is weird, but I hate not being able to watch all the movies I want to watch in one place.    


I also loved the variety of things I could watch.  


After the shut down, I decided to start building my own DVD library.  


Since I have hundreds of DVDs laying around, I'm interested in building a DVD rental service that's similar, but I'm still trying to figure out who would want this. (I know this is a niche market).

  
Is this something you might be interested in?  If so, I'm wondering if you'd take my survey?

I have horrible hearing so I put subtitles on before the movie started. It was very amusing to see the historical montages explaining major wider events that were taking place across the country along the story be portrayed with silent film footage as a result. I later learned that they really did create new footage for the silent film montages.

In addition I learned that many of the original screenplays of movies from the era actually really wrote actual lines. So when actors are talking onscreen, they were all from lines that were written in the script before the filming.

So I am now wondering. Were there any directors who thought of creating dialogue to be played alongside the characters speaking during the movie similar to modern subtitles today? Is there any known silent movie with the complete run time that did this or tries something that comes close to this idea?",0,3

Basically, I am exploring how film music make us feel. There's a quick questionnaire to look at your individual music listening habits. And then you get 10 randomly selected short film excerpts each, I want you to listen and annotate based on how you feel - it'll be clearer once you start.

Important Info: Please use your laptop or computer (no phones please!). Headphones or good speakers for the full experience. It'll take roughly 30mins to do depending on how detailed you want to be with it :)) At the end, you'll get your very own 'music listening personality.'

I'm knee-deep in my bachelors thesis exploring, how subscription based video on demand services are effecting cinema culture and I'm on the hunt for some literature to for my research.

I am particularly interested in books that address the following aspects:

* Changes in viewer behavior
* Conflicts between traditional cinemas and Video-on-Demand services
* Influences on the film industry and production
* Cultural impacts on the cinema experience

I have already considered some titles like ""The Age of Netflix – Critical Essays on Streaming Media, Digital Delivery and Instant Access"" or ""The Netflix Effect Technology and Entertainment in the 21st Century"" but both of these titles are focusing on TV-Production. (They're are pretty interesting tho, I highly recommend them for anyone, who is interested in that topic.)

If anyone knows of books specifically dealing with the conflict between traditional cinemas and Video-on-Demand services or more broadly related to cinema culture in the digital age, I would greatly appreciate your recommendations!

Thank you in advance!",1,0

Not sure I agree with that but wtf do I know? See Scorsese for instance?

Scorsese made ""Flower Moon"" at age 80 and Clint Eastwood's next film comes out here in 2024 at age 93.

&amp;#x200B;

Eastwood has had a string of great movies from age 73-93. Go figure. To each his own I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I know Quentin is not retiring. He will still write books and is looking to direct plays and even doing limited series for streaming. But, never making another movie after age 60? I think he could do 2 more great films over the next decade, but again, wtf do I know?

There was no any hype as the general feedback is that it is not up to the level of previous Scott's films. I was about to not to give even the opportunity but then I decided to spent three hours to build my own opinion. I definetly liked it. I've really enjoied it and I'll recommend it to my relatives/friends . The photography, the music, the characters, the way the history is centered on the personality of Napoleon and his relationship with Josephine. It might look like that the film is jumping from there to there, but historically is just going to key milestones that worth it to mention and I guess the director considered relevant to explain the way Napoleon was. There is one little detail that annoys me a little bit though. As a Spaniard I don't get why they decided to completelly ignore the Spanish campaign, it was specially tough and the way Napoleon invaded the Iberic peninsula explains a lot about his  psychopathy. For who don't know, he took advantage of the fact that Spain and France were allies back those times to send his army that in principle will cross Spain to invade Portugal that was an historical a UK ally. Even more relevant stuff was that in Spain took place the first battle that Napoleon loose, and actually wrapping up, Napoleon loose the war because of Spain and Rusia. What do you think guys? Why was this ignored at all? Spain was not even mention. Spain has been removed from history. ",0,1

For the longest time, in fact, the only form of education in many cultures was a good story. In those old days, we'd likely sit around a fire place to hear a tale from a powerful prophet or an erudite elder. Or perhaps, a travelling troubadour would come to the castle or village with an exciting tale to keep us talking for years and years. Either way, we have always instinctively known one thing.

Stories matter -- they help us know important truths about life.

Today, that instinct is alive and well.  We are blessed with many forms and mediums through which we can experience great stories and learn important truths of life. And in our modern age, there has never been a medium as influential as Cinema. (wait your turn Video Games).

Through cinema, these great truths can be played out right in front of our eyes. We can actually see that evil does not prosper, etc, etc. This is the great blessing of cinema -- you can show rather than tell a story which is a hundred times more effective when it comes to human beings. But every blessing comes with a curse (I think). Cinema, when done the wrong way, has a habit of feeding us fantasies, illusions and things that are not true.

This is the story that Damien Chazelle is trying to show us in his movie Babylon.

The debate surrounding this movie is nothing new. Critics found it extremely self indulgent and it bombed at the box office. The first time I watched it, in fact, I had a strong sense of aversion. As a film, it is self indulgent and many people recognize that. But just because it has a bad element to its making doesn't mean that the whole movie should be written off. One of the things that the movie did get right -- its story -- is what I would like to focus on in this study of the movie.  

The story is simple and beautiful. And its theme is very clear -- Know the truths of the fantasies that you choose. 

The story uses contrast between the two characters Manny and Nellie to push this theme forward. Manny is a Mexican immigrant working as an errand boy at a rich Hollywood Producers house while Nellie LaRoy is an out of work aspiring actress from New Jersey. Both are living lives of quiet desperation. Manny is an immigrant facing racism and lack of acceptance while Nellie is brash and poor. But there is something that gives their lives meaning and keeps them going -- the dream of Hollywood where the beautiful and the famous and all those who make movies can have everything they ever wanted alongside that sweet, sweet validation called fame that can be a heady as any drug in the world. 

Embodying this dream is Jack Conrad, an aging but generally well-meaning film star who seems to have it all -- 

1)Handsome and rich. Check. 

2)Beautiful women throwing themselves at him. Check.

3)A beautiful mansion. Check. Check. Check. 

When Manny meets Jack Conrad, he sees everything that he would like to be. And is absolutely honored and delighted when he is given the chance, alongside, Nellie La Roy to fulfill the dream that is Hollywood. 

But that's all the dream is presented to be -- a dream, an illusion -- when it is not paired with the truth. Nellie and Manny do not realize the reality that comes with their dreams and it leads them into a dark place. Nellie achieves her dream of becoming a film star but doesn't realize or seem to accept the reality connected to it -- 

1)The hard work and dedication. Nope. She develops a bad reputation for being difficult to work with. 

2)The importance of relationships (particularly with some awful people) in a business like show business. Nope. She antagonizes some rich influential people who are being snobbish towards her.

3)The fact that life as one giant bacchanal is impossible. Nope. She uses drugs and alcohol like no man's business.

Manny is wiser and soon becomes a Studio Executive but the higher he rises the more he is exposed the dark underbelly that is Hollywood until he realizes what his dream really is -- a dark and dangerous nightmare. There is a wonderful scene towards the end that really makes one think of the expression 'The greater the light, the greater the shadows produced"". In this case, there are no greater lights, in the world, than showbusiness lights.  

The exposure to the dark underbelly is also beautifully expressed through Jack Conrad who we discover is really just a miserable man who is afraid of that his age and technological advancements in cinema are going to take everything that Hollywood gave him away. 

The story pushes its theme or truth insistently so that every shot and character is really blinded by the lights of Hollywood. 

Manny survives the illusion and escapes Hollywood. He returns years later at the end of the film and watches Singing in the Rain (Babylon is the anti-Singing in the Rain) but he watches it as a spectator who now knows and understands that what he is watching is a movie -- fantasy and an illusion of what really happened. Everybody else has been gobbled up by Hollywood, by the lies. 

The lesson or truth of the story is simple -- again, know the truth of the fantasies that you choose.

We all need dreams and fantasies to sustain us through life, I think. There has to be something to keep us moving. But the truth and the warning that Damien Chazelle offers is that the fantasy we choose must be coupled with the realities that come with it or it will destroy us. 

You fantasize about becoming a King, then you had better embody everything that being a King embodies while accepting the fact that your life will be one of constant fights to preserve your power, popularity and relevance. 

You fantasize about being a great and successful musician, then you had better be the most talented musician in the world while accepting the fact that you might have to make music that the majority likes even when you might not like it. 

Manny drops his fantasy when he realizes that he cannot accept the reality. But Nellie LaRoy doesn't and cannot (which is the Greek Tragedy of her character) because it is the only thing that keeps her going. And it keeps her going straight to her death.  

Babylon is a lot of things that people do not like but its story is very powerful indeed at least according to our definition of story. It tells us a truth about life that we definitely have to be aware of. And in that sense, Babylon's story really MATTERS a lot.

Thank You.

Tonight I'm going to the cinema to watch ""Perfect Days"" by Wim Wenders. While watching the trailer, I felt that sense of well-being that some movies give me without being able to understand why. In fact, when asked ""why are you going to see it?"" I dismissed everyone by saying ""because it's an Oscar nominee for Best International Film,"" while deep down I knew I couldn't give myself a satisfactory answer.

For example, when I watch ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage, I get emotional about the whole family aspect, etc.   
Thinking about ""Parasite,"" I recall the beauty of that film, but when trying to explain it logically, I can't figure out why. I just really like it. Sometimes I give myself a straightforward answer, saying, ""Of course, you love to travel, you like movies set in certain places,"" and it's probably partially true. However, I'm not convinced that it's all thanks to travel and location.

Does this ever happen to you? What are your thoughts?",4,4

I have a question about the legal rights to use a specific name in a film. In particular, it is about the name of Steve Jobs. The movie is about a character who listens to an audiobook which is a pseudo biography of Steve Jobs. He also feels extreme respect for him. However, there's a moment where one of the characters says, ""screw Steve Jobs.""
My question is this since the movie is already filmed, is there an option where I overdub specific moments with with ""Yves Moopes"" or something - though not the best solution. option is to cut the last ""with"" from their conversations and get ""Steve Job""
Since the film is in a foreign language also in the subtitles it could say ""Steve Jop"" .

I denied myself practically nothing. Since childhood, I had a dream of acting in films, participating in various filming. Many people know that Russian actors are mostly children of actors and in the minority are truly talented people.

Just recently I wrote my book, but I haven’t published it anywhere. At that time, I was eager to make a film based on it with my participation. I have the majority to make my dream come true - all the filming premises, acting skills, a clear plot. But there is no film crew, no actors and no opportunity to release this movie into the world.
I don’t have any friends in the film industry who could help me create and launch.
I understand that you can simply contact any film crew, make a film and pay the cameraman, editor, and so on.

I think it was a great movie, great script, great acting (aside from the Ric Flair actor). However I think that they should have scrambled around some of the actors particularly for me I think Zac Efron should have been Karry and Jeremy Allen White should have been Kevin. Efron's got the jaw, got the tan, got the looks, and got the name just like Kerry did, and Kevin was never the big star like Kerry was, just like at the moment, Jeremy Allen White isn't as big a household name as Zac Efron. IDK I just get frustrated with some production decisions in our current television culture. And I definitely think they got lazy on the Ric Flair actor and plot line... At the time Ric Flair was an essential part of how the von Erich became a household name in wrestling. And although I don't think that the Flair actor was a bad actor I just think he definitely did not at all get close to the personality of '80s Ric Flair. What do you guys think?",3,4

I love their nihilist pessimist philosophy. 

Is tom Cruise playing another similar characters. I didn't see rain man and eyes wides shut, so maybe they are villains like the other movies that I love. 

Do you have other similar characters ?

We all know what an incredible filmmaker Chris Nolan is; and how iconic ‘The Dark Knight’ is.  
But a lot of fans don’t know that Nolan had no intention of making ""The Dark Knight."" ""Batman Begins"" was meant to be a standalone project, but it changed everything with its dark take on the Caped Crusader. Nolan had done his bit for the superhero genre and was ready to move on to more personal and original projects. But here's where the story takes a turn. The concept of ""escalation"" entered Nolan's mind.  


A Ziploc bag held the key—Gary Oldman's Commissioner Gordon hinting at the Joker and setting the stage for chaos and anarchy. Nolan and writer David S. Goyer were on a mission to make the Joker truly terrifying, a stark departure from the comedic interpretations of the past.  


""I liked the \[Tim\] Burton films, a lot,"" said Goyer, recalling that director’s fantasias Batman and Batman Returns, ""- but the one bone to pick with film, television, anything: I just never felt that the Joker was scary. Chris and I wanted the Joker to be scary.""  Not simply scary, but thematically diabolical. He wasn’t so much a character as a catalyst – a dark philosophy for a new kind of Batman movie. ‘The Joker is what I am afraid of more than anything,’ said Nolan.  


‘More than any of the villains, these days particularly, when you feel civilization is very thinly lined. I think the Joker represents the id in all of this.'” Heath Ledger delivered a performance that sent shivers down spines. The Joker wasn't just scary; he was a force of nature, a dark philosophy personified.  


Ledger's Joker would go on to become the gold standard for the character. The Batman trilogy delved into the psyche of a vigilante in a city on the brink of chaos, reshaping the superhero genre.  


In the end, Christopher Nolan's unexpected journey gave us ""The Dark Knight,"" a movie that transcends the genre, reminding us that the best things can happen when least expected.

I must apologize for that. I'm normally more careful. But consider this: what scared you more, the fact that I was in your home, or the fact that you have now awakened in mine? You see, you are not as terrified by my presence in your home, for I may have been a simple robber aiming to take your valuables, or perhaps I was a serial killer intending to take your life. The latter is much worse than robbery, yes, I know, but it would be over quickly. Now that you sit here in the silence of my home, trapped in a cage of my making, uprooted from the familiar yet false safety of your abode, do you not feel dread and hopelessness setting in? Do you struggle to comprehend your situation? You have stared at the walls and seen my tools, and your mind goes to the worst places. I can see it in your eyes. You would much rather die now, wouldn't you?

Are you a man of faith?

Christianity uses hell to scare people away from sin, for there is no fate worse than unending torment. By going through this journey with me, I will take you down to its depths. You will now walk where sinners walk.

You have failed.

 By falling into my hands, You are no longer a human being.""

Unexpected collaborations often give birth to true magic. A great example of this is the collaboration between the King of Pop and Martin Scorsese.  


Back in 1983, Michael Jackson was riding high on the success of “Thriller.”  


However, the pressure to surpass this triumph, coupled with personal challenges and a pyrotechnic mishap during a Pepsi commercial shoot in 1984, pushed Jackson into a period of seclusion and physical recovery.  


The incident not only left him with visible scars but also initiated a struggle with painkiller addiction.  


Yet, amidst the struggles, a meeting with his musical rival, Prince, spurred Jackson to refocus on his art.  


In 1986, as Michael Jackson sought to reclaim his throne, his producer approached none other than Martin Scorsese to direct the music video and screenwriter Richard Price (who had just finished making The Colour of Money (1986) together) for the title track of his upcoming album, “Bad.”  


Scorsese embraced the challenge, marking his first and only foray into the world of music videos.  


Scorsese’s directorial touch transformed the “Bad” music video into an 18-minute short film, delving into the gritty themes of New York crime.  


Inspired by the musical “West Side Story” and real-life events, the narrative follows a young teenager’s struggle to break free from a life of crime and make a fresh start.  


The original script had a private school kid killed in a Harlem shootout. But in the final version, they decided to let the boy live. The result was one of Jackson’s biggest music videos, showing the realism of New York.  


Interestingly, this music video became the debut of Wesley Snipes who played the role of Mini Max making the video even more interesting and leading him on the path to fame.  


Around the middle of the 18-minute production, the music kicks in, showcasing Jackson’s choreographed routine in a single take, using a moving camera technique.

So theres this kid who is a trouble maker, and his family is very poor. They live in a small village (I can't remember where it was) and a movie theater its created, so all the village goes to see movies there. Theres this old man that is the one who plays the movies, the little kid always goes to see him work (one thing I remember, it was something like the 1978 where they was still using those magnetic tapes, I don't know what you guys call, so it was a hard work to do since you had to be very careful). At one moment something goes wrong with the machine that played the movies and the movie theater starts to burn, the old man is trapped inside there so the little kid saves his life by taking him outside.

Whilst the recent offspring of the courtroom drama genre ""The Trial of The Chicago Seven"" failed to fully immerse me due to Sorkin's obsession with overwriting his so-called 'intelligent' dialogue, that very dialogue manages to fully captivate and mesmerize me here. Not because Triet's writing is more poetic, wittier or vast than Sorkins; quite the opposite. Triet understands when to hold back what is essential to the viewer and when the right time has come to reveal these details; managing to reveal details naturally in the story and never feeling forced upon the viewer.
The court case itself is captivating, never predictable and the movie even finds the time to question why we are so captivated by it in the first place.
None of this however is the actual main point of the story to begin with, since Justine Triet's ambitions go way beyond the genre, using it more so as a vehicle to explore other ideas.


A matter of Perspective

When we arrive in the courtroom our understanding of the protagonists former relationship is negligible, other than a (beautiful) montage of photographs in the opening credits, we know nothing about them. Triet uses the investigation to investigate this very relationship in all of it's flaws and fault. She shows us creative differences, intense relationship drama and skewed power dynamics without ever painting an over simplistic victim/perpetrator picture.
It is an exercise in ever changing perspectives which to me is the most fascinating aspect of this incredibly acted out movie.
Be it the differing interpretations on provided evidence surrounding the case, or different camera perspectives putting us into ever changing POV's. There are super specific cases to exemplify this like ultra close ups emulating a certain character's view of the world. Another example are the metaphorical cases where returning to bygone conversations, with newly added context, changes the perspective, sometimes to us and other times to the characters, of what it could have meant beneath the surface all along.
The playful ambiguity surrounding this theme is nothing short of breathtaking to me.
I can't wait to return to this film, to pick up on even more examples, fully aware it might change my own perspective on ""Anatomy of a Fall"" once more.

AS someone learning Polish right now, I am amazed at how many movies from Poland you can find with English subtitle files for on the internet and more than half of them never even got an official DVD release in America release or availability on major streaming services with English subs. And in addition a friend of mine just translated one of Meiko Kaji's movies with English subs using a software that creates accurate subtitles using the video's audio because its one of her lesser known stuff even in Japan and thus does not have any downloadable subs available.

It got me wondering............ Is pretty quick run-time of movies a prime factor why it got the most localization more than any other foreign media )and not just subtitles but even dubs)? That the reason why we could get so much Kung Fu movies from Hong Kong  during the 70s and 80s to rent at video stores was because due to their pretty short playtime they were inherently less risky to localize than say a 3 season TV show from France or a weekly radio drama from Colombia?

After all look at all the exported TV shows to the rest of the world that gets dubbed or subbed into other languages. Its pretty much the most popular stuff like Friends, Dallas, Charlie's Angels, Star Trek, Buffy the Vampire Slayers, Xena, and  the X-Files. Almost all shows that just had average popularity in America like The O.C. and Living Single did not get exported into other country's for a proper localization with dubs or at least subtitles and the few countries that did get them properly localised never got a DVD or VHS compilation.

In addition take a look at the mass wide amount of Japanese video games that never got translated even into English including stuff actually popular in Japan and things published by major companies. As well as most French comics not getting translted into America and the rest of the world except Asterix the Gaul and same with popular German, Italian, Swedish, and other countries' comics from across Europe.........

Makes me wonder if cinema's pretty fast length was a prime reason why we could get lots of niche movies from Korea translated into English for a DVD release and same with all the fansubs of Arabic movies,  the Criterion release of Swedish masterpieces, etc?",0,1

I want the theatre experience to survive. My fondest childhood experiences in the Movies were watching Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Poltergeist. . . in the theatre.  However, even before the pandemic, the movie theatre experience was going downhill.  They started pushing ads before the previews, and soon there were ad before the theatre went dark.  Fine, everyone ignores it and are on their phones during this time.  For me, at least we had an Arclight Cinema in town which kept ads out.  I'd make it a point to see movies there (old and new releases)

However, Arclight closed down and I'm now left with Regal Cinemas . . Regal and many theatre chains copied Arclight by allowing reserved seats.  But that's about all they've done right.  I haven't been to a Regal theatre in years, but I really wanted to go see Godzilla: Minus One last night (Great movie...I highly recommend it).  I can say without any reservation, the current incarnation of the Movie going experience is driving movie goers away.

The movie showtime was 7:40, the lights dim and we are given 18 minutes of straight up ads.  Not movie documentaries, quizzes, previews of upcoming films. Ads.  Ads for cars. Ads, for Walmart shopping. Ads for M&amp;M's. Ads for soft drinks.  18 minutes of this crap. Some ads were shown repeatedly.  Then we are given trailers, 6 of them, after the 3rd one, we are given . . .a repeat of a car ad. So for my $18 (non-IMAX showing) ticket of a 2 hour movie, with an advertised start time of 7:40PM, the movie started at 8:08PM.  If theatre owners are wondering why there are dwindling numbers of theatre-goers, the experience you are providing SUCKS.  No one is going to pay for an experience that is 20% ads.   At this rate, the movie theatre is going to go the way of the arcade, killed off by a better experience at home and something this generation will wax nolstagic about or seen in ""Stranger Things""  I truly hope not, seeing movies on the big screen should be a treat.  Its now another avenue for advertisers and is soiling the entire theatre experience.

I figured I'd check as I need an answer to this fairly stupid question. 

I loved Leaving Las Vegas more than anything Ive ever seen. It was twisted and wrong, gut wrenchingly relatable and impossibly divine. I loved it as it came at the right time and place in my life, down to the hour. Much the same as the love Sera had for Ben. Gorgeous cinematography, soundtrack, and performances. Putrid beyond words and beyond beautiful in essence concurently. Definitely the most impactul and artful representation of vice, meaning, and self-worth and the sale of it that ive ever seen. The Rolex analogy for Sera alone was out of this world.

 I'm craving more of the same. I can't spend the rest of this evening of rumination on anything that will wipe clean that feeling entirely but I must watch something else to fill the void in my soul/calendar. What do you all recommend?

Also would like to hear random thoughts and feelings about this movie from lovers and haters of it as I just loved it. Could go on and on about it and probably will if anyone cares to comment. Cheers.",13,7

Hey guys, I was thinking of trying Odeon Limitless but there are a couple of things that make me debate whether it’s worth it or not. 

This year I’ve been really into going to the cinema, whilst I was working in my home town I was near the cinema all the time, and went at least once a week, often more, and saw basically everything at least twice. Now, I’m at university, and the nearest cinema isn’t really convenient to get to, it’s in the opposite direction to the city centre and the university, the length of the walk is highly dependent on traffic because there are a lot of complicated junctions to cross and fairly busy roads that don’t have crossings, the cinema itself isn’t in a particularly pedestrianised area either. Still, this last month I’ve been going once a week (for new releases) and I’d like to see some of them again yet don’t necessarily want to pay for them again, especially with the inconvenience of the walk. 

I thought a Limitless membership might be worth it for me, every cinema ticket is £5 and the membership is £14.99, so I would have to go three times in a month for it to be worth it which I think is doable. But I looked at it yesterday and turns out there are quite a few caveats. 

Firstly, the minimum subscription is three months, I like the offerings this month but January and February famously don’t have particularly exciting releases, plus when I’m home over Christmas I won’t be able to use the membership since my closest Odeon there is a Luxe, which requires an upcharge. 

Secondly, you can only hold four tickets at a time and see maximum four films a day, I like booking tickets in advance and I also love spending all day at the cinema when timings work out, so that might be an issue. It also says tickets must be at least 90 minutes apart, which is unclear if that’s from start time or end time, and if it’s end time that would make it almost impossible to see multiple films. It also doesn’t allow any overlaps, I often book tickets that overlap when I see multiple films because between credits and trailers an overlap of up to 20 minutes isn’t really a problem, but if they won’t allow any then that makes seeing four films in one day practically impossible. 

I’m honestly not sure on this so would appreciate any input :)",1,1

So I ask why is 3 hours considered long for a movie? I mean having seen Gone With the Wind for a history class, I don't understand why my classmates were complaining its so long considering 3 hours goes fast playing Virtua Fighter like less than 10 minutes have gone by during the whole practise session and I can easily binge through 10 episodes of Scrubs?

1. The space exists on earth but not in a human world reality. 
2. This space exists on earth in our known humane reality.
3. The space is on another planet entirely.
4. The space exists on another planet (so to say) which exists on Earth (??) or in humane reality. 
5. The space exists in complete isolation in a vacuum.
6. The space exists in isolation from the world but within it.
7. The space is imagined by characters living in the known world.
8. The space (Zone and Room) is metaphysical or metaphorical and it's existence as such was essential for the movie, the premise (the alien landing or whatever) of how it came to exist in the world where it is accessible to human characters was only created as a logistical necessity so that the characters' human lives could be connected to the revelations that happen in the space. Meaning, this change of space in the film, from known to unknown/undescribed does not have much significance beyond establishing the characters and their world in the known to contextualise the events that take place in the unknown. 
9. The travel from a space known to the space unknown, and the geographically logistical &amp; theoretical explanation of the connection between the two spaces is actually significant in understanding the unknown space and grants it attributes for us to know what the unknown space is.


I am trying to analyse this, and the reason why we watched this movie with a certain perspective, is because I am writing a screenplay in which there are only three characters, all of whom are personifications of abstract philosophical and metaphysical ideas, which the movie states explicitly. I have the characters, I have the story but to make it fit for Cinema I need to identify and visualise a space and setting for the movie to play out. I have been researching movies which have created experimental settings that would allow beyond-human characters to engage in isolation from 'people' and societal aspects of our reality. I am doing this to figure out the space which can be visually created in which my personified abstractions could operate as characters.


In this context, can you guys please contextualise the space and setting used in Stalker, preferably evidencing your explanations/perspectives? 

And it would also be great if you could recommend any movies or shows or articles or papers or basicallyyyy anything that could help me.",0,1

🇬🇧 “The close-up, the correctly illuminated, directed and acted close-up of an actor is and remains the height of cinematography. There is nothing better. That incredibly strange and mysterious contact you can suddenly experience with another soul through an actor’s gaze. A sudden thought, blood that drains away or blood that pumps into the face, the trembling nostrils, the suddenly shiny complexion or mute silence, that is to me some of the most incredible and fascinating moments you will ever experience.” — Ingmar Bergman

In Cinema, the way something is filmed means everything, and helps in telling a story. How much, and what does it reveal or hide? Does it move in or out of the frame? How well is it lit? In the context of the visual language of a movie, (or an author) meaning arises from all these choices and more. Here, we focus on Ingmar Bergman's representation of the human face. What do you think about it?

🍕 ""Il primo piano, il primo piano correttamente illuminato diretto e recitato, di un attore è e rimane il culmine della cinematografia. Non c'è niente di meglio. Quel contatto incredibilmente strano e misterioso che si può improvvisamente sperimentare con un'altra anima attraverso lo sguardo di un attore. Un pensiero improvviso, il sangue che svanisce o il sangue che affluisce al viso, le narici che tremano, il viso improvvisamente luminoso o il silenzio muto, questi sono per me alcuni dei momenti più incredibili e affascinanti che potrai mai vivere."" — Ingmar Bergman

Nel Cinema, il modo in cui qualcosa viene ripreso significa tutto e contribuisce a raccontare una storia. Quanto e cosa rivela o nasconde? Entra o esce dall'inquadratura? Quanto è illuminato? Nel contesto del linguaggio visivo di un film (o di un autore), il significato nasce da tutte queste scelte e non solo. Noi oggi ci concentriamo sulla rappresentazione del volto umano da parte di Ingmar Bergman. Tu cosa ne pensi?",0,2

The show is painfully slow, boring, and redundant. I kept waiting, thinking, that the next episode would be the one that makes me go ""Oh! I get the hype now!"" But the entire time I was just pissed off at the main character, who is a god awful comedian by the way (am I supposed to like him and want his comedic career to take off?)

Each episode would follow the ""rising action"" part of the story and end on a cliff hanger. Then the next episode would never reach a climax or conflict but just build up the rising action again. It feels like watching a rough draft of an indie project that should be scrapped.

I get that it's a ""true story"" but not every interesting story needs to be made into a TV series. The hype and 98% rotten tomatoes score are wildly undeserved. Could have made an interesting Youtube video or 1 episode of a true crime series, at the most.

So she says that 'Martha' is based on her, did nothing to refute the claims once people found out and played into it, going as insane on facebook as the Netflix Martha was made out to be, making posts all day everyday every 2 minutes, you can load up her facebook and almost guarantee a post within the last 10 minutes, claiming she was the one being stalked and harassed by Richard. 

But then she wants to play the ""i never did any of these things, i never emailed him and have never been to jail"" . But then its not you is it love? Could be someone else if you actually didnt do any of that, but no, she confirmed it was her on facebook but also wanted to play the victim . So if you didn't do these things, and didnt harass Richard, didnt have any contact with him and only knew him as the barman what makes you still think its about you . Like its definitely her. It would be like a documentary about a serial killer comes out, then someone comes out and says ""oh yeh this documentary is about me, but i didnt kill anyone""",5,0

Basically, for those who decided to pick it up, it provided quite the contrast in theme and content: a very cute, wholesome refresher after having been subjected to multiple gruesome deaths and intense adrenaline. I could imagine those people getting to sigh and gush over Kiyo's masterful cooking, bubbly demeanor, and friendliness to the people around her, especially Sumire - all after having to witness what seemed to be hours of the King of Spades perpetrating one of the most horrifying massacres in a movie/series (plus people being blown up by explosive collars and melted by sulfuric acid).

That said, the panelists have been a bit meh in terms of showing up. Don’t get me wrong John Stewart is also great at this bit, but it just was a bit meh, down the middle. And then with the awkward local experts (which, as a bit, are super funny in terms of an overall concept) are also a bit meh, but again expected and fun to watch Mulaney handle it. Nate Bargatze is awesome too and again the show is great overall, for what it is. Richard Kind getting better too as it goes.

So, what can people recommend in terms of shows like The OA but were completed?

Thank you!

Thank you all for suggestions. I realize there won't be anything ""like"" it. I should've asked what other mind-bending shows would you recommend that were complete and not cancelled.

I usually get the ad-free version of netflix for one month at a time, a few times throughout the year to catch up on things. I hadn't finished some of the shows I was watching, and instead of pay full price I decided to get the ad-supported plan since I only had a few things left to watch on there.

I primarily watch Netlfix on my TV through chromecast. I've never had an issue watching it before.  
Once I changed to the ad-supported plan, nothing would play on my TV.  
Error code: AIP-703, R7111-1331

Meanwhile the ad-supported plan is advertised as able to ""watch on ANY device.""

When I contacted support, I was told that I would need to upgrade to watch on my TV.

I understand I'm using an older technology and there can be limitations. BUT I'm incredibly frustrated by the false advertising of the ad-supported plans claiming to be able to watch on any device when that's simply not true. I think most people would assume that if the ad-free version of Netlfix worked fine, the ad version would also work fine. I've never had an issue watching Hulu with Ads, or HBO MAX with Ads. This is the only time such an issue has presented itself.

I was able to settle the issue relatively quickly with support and get a refund, which I appreciated. The ad-supported plan isn't worth it for me, so I'll just wait til something good comes out on Netflix and spend the money to get the ad-free version. As mentioned, my customer service experience was fine and I appreciate them making things right by cancelling my account and issuing a refund.

That said, I really think they need to change their advertising and add an asterisk to ""any device"" or simply put ""most devices"" and allow you to check for compatibility before starting a plan. I can't imagine I'm the first person to experience this problem and it does feel deceptive in my opinion.",0,0

No one deserves to be stalked. He does not deserve to be stalked. He does not deserve to be assaulted. He does not deserve to suffer. He does not deserve to be in fear or terrorized at all. Low self-esteem is real in men.

I know someone who has been stalked, and it's horrific. It's debilitating; she moved to another city, she reported everything to the police and they were limited in what they could do, but she was very upfront about it with the police. She didn't try to goad her stalker into sending a threatening email to her, she didn't neglect to report her stalker when said stalker (in reference to the show here) threw pop in the ex's face, she didn't neglect to report that her stalker sent numerous social media messages of threatening nature to a friend, and she didn't neglect to report said stalker cut her face with glass. But by all accounts, she did stand up to herself. Letting someone consume your mental and physical safety/peace takes more from someone than feeling like you ""lost"" from not reporting it to the police.

My primary concern with this show, and the post interview material he has published with ""stalking is romanticized as sexy on television, so I wanted to disrupt that media"" concept, coupled with the first few episodes, seems like he's asking people to sympathize and excuse a lot of these inactions simply because he wasn't courageous enough to do so. Yes, his confessional monologue gives some insight into why he cowers from it, but it feels more like he's deflecting than genuinely taking responsibility to his own inaction, and how he never even really seemed to get help from it (which he certainly needed), but rather greatly profited off it. He writes about these awful experiences, wins an Oliver award for it, then Netflix buys the show, he writes the show, stars in it, and in the last episode as he mentions, launches his career. Then he returns working with the man that drugged and repeatedly sexually abused him? That is a conscious decision.

Stalking really is awful, and it should never be seen as this ""romantic endeavour."" It's cracked that anyone thinks that show is ""sexy."" At no pint should stalking be portrayed as such. I hope no one gets stalked in their lives, but if they do, I hope they know inaction is, in fact, letting them win. You have to do your best to protect yourself and continue your life the best she can.

Victim Blaming is saying ""oh, that woman was asking for it,"" when she is raped because she wore a tank top, or she drank too much. Victim Blaming is saying ""he shouldn't have taken those drugs that knocked him out so much,"" when he's raped or sexually assaulted. Those assaults are real. They exist, they're not void. It is the victim's responsibility to fight for yourself, and selling/creating media that doesn't acknowledge that straddles enablement.",27,0

Spoiler (I doubt anyone would watch after all the reviews tho) but i did finish the series.

Honestly, im not sure what the series is aiming for specifically. Since there are million things happened at once…

First, what I was confused about the whole series is that why would there be a human trafficking happening? Well the cult thing sure made a little sense but what da earth is human trafficking in there??? And especially the place where they kidnaped all the girls to do the segs work. It doesnt make sense because they had literally a whole year to evacuate but all the people decides “we should start kidnap kids and do business before the asteroid hit the planet (in which Korea is the bullseye)” 

Second, i dont get why they all felt helpless when there is safe zone. Well tbh, other country would have accepted refugees in this situation. But they went as far as to create cult just to board the airship to the US that will crash for absolutely no reason. Also where is the government beside the In Ah’s military squad…",7,0

Netflix has always been famous for having a fairly equal amount of male and female nudity, but for several years we have only seen male frontal nudity, and sometimes even explicit male nudity, including erect penises, such as in the latest series A Man in Full.

Story line with Jeff Daniel's as a real estate mogul who's $1B assets and loans with one bank are in jeopardy of making him bankrupt and lose all credibility with the City of Atlanta. 
There's one story line I don't get. Conrad Croker (Jeff Daniel) has a secretary (Chante Adam's). Whose husband - named Conrad in the show - has an altercation with Atl police over a parking ticket. 
At the time of incident (I think Ep 2) his car is pushed into a zone with no parking. Hence the police ticketing car and a tow truck about to tow vehicle.
Officer is white and Conrad is black. 
After the officer pretty much throws the character onto car purposely hitting him in back of head the character (Conrad/Husband of secretary) assaults officer. That then spirals out of control after incarceration pending trial and Judge pretty much not listening to lawyer. 

This story line seems disjointed from the broader plot between Croker (alleged billionaire real-estate mogul) and bank. And has gone on for at least thru Ep 5 which I'm on. 

Am I missing some context that I may have missed in first episode? I can appreciate shows that spotlight injustices in our legal system.

I've browsed the other posts regarding subtitles but none quite reflect (that I could see anyway) what my issue with Netflix is. Please forgive me if this is a tired post and people are over it and please point in the direction of a solution. 

Anyway, the other night I was watching The Martian. Having seen this in the movies and having it on Blu-ray, I know that when it goes to the Chinese space agency, when they speak mandarin (again forgive me if it is not mandarin), it is subtitled. Yet, on Netflix, there was nothing. 

To fix this I had to turn on English subtitles, but this gave me subtitles even when people were speaking English.

I was wondering if there was a setting on Netflix, where I can get it to give me the English translation when English is not being spoken, but not when English is being spoken?

It just seems odd to me that this isn't built in.

It wasn't funny. But it was fun. Few of the jokes landed with me. They were in the vicinity of funny but they weren't quite there. It's clearly a satire on 1960s culture, but it's not a pointed satire and it doesn't really have anything much to say about the sixties, which is kind of a relief, because, let's face it, a lot has been said about the sixties.

Also it doesn't take anything in the story seriously. You never have a sense that anything is at stake in the story. 

Still, it has a goofy charm to it. I would describe it as not so much a parody or a satire, but an alternate world story. I felt that I was watching a version of the sixties that never happened. The divergences from our sixties were consistently goofy and strange in a relaxed kind of way. It's a mildly pleasant ride that you can watch with one eye on a tablet or a phone and have a perfectly good time while doing so. Maybe browse Reddit or something.

In fact, thinking about it, ""Unfrosted"" is kind of a softcore porn movie without the porn, if softcore movie creators were capable of creating mildly amusing stories (they are not, of course). 

If you set your expectations on ""low"" and your tablet on ""browse"" you'll probably find this movie kind of fun. Just don't watch it with you full attention. Most of the reviews by critics who have done so are kinda grumpy.",38,32

The realistic, non-platforming answer, is we have literally no idea if infinity exists.

Today it is old and therefor incapable of streaming Netflix as updated on May 3, 2024.   One will need to buy a new Samsung television in order to stream Netflix as updated or use a secondary device which Netflix refuses to provide.

Netflix did an update between May 2, 2024 and May 3, 2024.

The result is that on a Samsung UN50F5500 the application is no longer usable.

I called Dan at Netflix Customer support, he verified that there was an update and it would no longer permit viewing of Netflix on that Television.   The call was made at 1:58 PM on their computer system.

Dan volunteered that the TV was still capable of viewing Netflix, but I would now need a device like Roku or something else.   I asked Dan to send me the device.  Netflix rendered my viewing inoperable this is a way to fix it, I was ready to give Dan the address and he said that I would have to buy the device

Dan and I were getting nowhere so a supervisor/manager Lauren took over the call

I informed Lauren that there was no notice of the update.  Lauren corrected me and said that a notice sent out on the device.  I informed Lauren that I had watched the device everyday for the last week and there was no notice that I viewed.  Lauren informed me that there was supposed to be a notice

Lauren said In order to provide the high quality that Netflix aspires to, that it will no longer be available on the Samsung device.   It is Lauren's position that not being able to watch any videos on the device is providing high quality for this customer.

I asked Lauren if I was watching the videos yesterday and they were clear and the audio was good.  and today if I'm unable to watch videos what quality did I have yesterday?   Lauren said  Yesterday I was getting  high quality.   And she also said that today not being able to have clear video and good audio was high quality.   I informed Lauren that I was confused about Netflix ideas about high quality.

Lauren informed me was that this update would provide high-video quality in the future.   I asked her what about high video quality now - I reminded her that there was no video and no audio.

She informed me that I would have to buy a new device in order to enjoy the high quality in the future.   I receive cable television on this device.   I receive Prime on this device.  I receive Paramount plus on this device, and I receive Hulu on the device.   Up until yesterday I received Netflix on this Samsung  device.  Today I do not, and Netflix is aware that they rendered these device(s) inoperable.

I asked Lauren for the address of the legal department, her predecessor Dan had been unable to get it to me.   She said she would send it to me by e-mail.

Query has anybody else had the same type of high quality visited upon them as this Netflix user?

I parted with does Netflix intend to do anything to remedy the situation.  Lauren's answer was they intend to do nothing to remedy the situation.

Lauren agreed that Netflix has chosen not provide the device to its customers and that is a business decision.

Ideas?

I always end up calling Canal+'s customer service and then Netflix's one and Netflix always asks for a new email address and I keep creating new ones.

There were just so many things he did “wrong” that it was difficult. Especially since he had such good friends and family. Obviously he was very weak inside and scared but what made him like that?

I stream anime on Netflix using a 5 year old 4k tv from PHILLIPS and It looks good????? 

This is driving me crazy, I've googled countless times and no one can give a straight answer on why the sharpness and quality of anime varies so drastically across displays?

It doesn’t take it self too seriously but doesn’t try to be anything other than campy cheesy fun but it does have depth. 

For someone who is not familiar with the comics, the sandman or doom patrol…..I decided to watch this over a course of the last couple of days.  

Admittedly because the two male leads are cute but honestly it wasn’t that bad.  

It definitely was more on the teen/cw vibes of things with the camp but shockingly it didn’t hit cringe level too often.  

The two male leads are phenomenal actors for their ages and characters and while I didn’t care for the female lead character I will say it is good to see proper representation of a woman of color who is allowed to be badass even if I find her character annoying. 

The balance in humor and banter mixed perfectly with themes of abandonment, abuse, trauma, infidelity, sexuality and acceptance.  

I’d argue this is probably the best Netflix adaptation for a teen show only because the characters realistically act like teens but it’s not over the top melodrama like something you’d see on the Cw. 

My minor issues is that while the two male leads are incredible….the two female leads come off as weak and it makes it hard to care especially when they try to push crystal to the front.  

Thankfully, around episode 5 or 6 they stopped heavily leaning on her and focused more on the dynamics that were stronger.  

The way that it ends is perfect for a one off.  Not too bad of a cliff hanger but also if it gets a renewal it sets the groundwork.  

I definitely will be back.

Hit pause at any single moment during the series 8 hour runtime &amp; you have an image that is worthy of a spot on an art gallery wall.

What bothered me as I watched the series was Scott's performance.  There is not a single moment where the character shows anything that would be perceived by any person as genuine.  There is no charm, no warmth, &amp; little if any charisma.  Marge and Freddie IMMEDIATELY key in on this, but Ripley mostly gets a pass from everyone else.  

As I reflect on the series more; I actually think it works.  This isn't the ""real"" world of blue collar folk.  This is a world of the uber wealthy from Fitzgerald's Gatsby.  Tom's ability to blend in (to the extent he does) is because his sociopathy is not so different from the vapid characters who we expect in those circles.  He is able to exists socially with these people not because he hides his true self, but because his true nature is barely distinguishable from their facades.  Tom wouldn't last 5 minutes in Manhattan, Kansas.... but once in the orbit of the elite, he can grift indefinitely so long as fate and luck are on his side.  

I can even use this to explain away the one scene that most strained credulity for me.  Ripley adorns a wig and masks himself in dim lighting to deceive the detective who has met him numerous times.  But he makes no attempt to modulate his voice or change any mannerism he has.  How does he get one over on this inspector?  I think it's that he's American.  I believe his voice is less distinct to someone who isn't a native born English speaker.  And his mannerisms just seem appropriate to an entitled trust fund guy.  It's stretching a bit to make it work for me, bit it's a good enough reason. 

On the whole, Ripley is a visual masterpiece and and outstanding example of building tension.  Long scenes free of dialog show an advantage that the small screen has over its big brother.  We are allowed to explore this world in painstaking detail.  Actions too mundane to be included in a theatrical film are allowed to play out in their entirety here, adding layers upon layers of depth and a mounting sense of dread. ",8,13

I never heard of the Netflix Home Network until yesterday.  I just searched on this subreddit and see posts going back months.  What made Netflix enforce this change?

Wife &amp; I were at the gym.  She tried login to Netflix to watch something and was told she didn't have access.  I tried on my phone, as the primary account holder, and found the same message.  We attempted the temporary code and that didn't work.  So no Netflix watching at the gym for the Wife.  

Got home and looked into it further.  See that we had to go on our TV and setup Home Network through Netflix on Roku.  OK, did that.  Then see we have to go on each device and stream for a short bit to authenticate those devices.  Did that, seems like all is well now.

But WTH Netflix?  This seemed to come out of left field.  Not being able to watch when we are paying $$ for the service is really irresponsible.  Kinda want to demand a refund even though it would probably be like $0.25.

I have not hated any character recently more than this evil monster. 

**The father** is another nutcase. Good for nothing, obsessed with his cheating wife, only god knows what thoughts he had about his daughter!! Was he really loved his wife that much that he tried to hide many things from the law? Or was it for the money that she would've inherited? Also, why was he and/or his wife drugging their own daughter in the name of allergies but she never had any?!

It was well acted, well written, well shot, and covers a subject that is often overlooked.  But I just felt awful after watching it.

I dont care if its realistic, and it really is sad for the real people this was based off. But it was just miserable to sit through. It started off fine, and I liked the dark comedy elements of it. Then after the rape it just devolved into misery.  I couldnt even finish it (I stopped mid episode 6 when I realized its not going to have a happy ending) because Im sure it has a depressing ending. Dont advertise as being a comedy, when its really just misery porn.  The trailer even made it look like a comedy, which it very much isnt.

It felt like a bait and switch.  I get that it was advertised as a ""Dark"" comedy.  But other then the main characters witty jokes, it wasnt funny in the slightest.  I just felt depressed and unhappy after watching it, and thats not what I was looking for.

Also Terri was a horrible therapist. Shes trying to sleep with the guy, and he cant perform due to very obvious trauma, and all she can think about is herself. Shes supposed to be a therapist and she cant tell Donny is dealing with some seriously messed up issues?  She even thinks it has to do with her being trans, acting so self centered.

I’ve seen the original anime before years ago with an ex of mine so I was vaguely familiar with the lore. Gotta say the Netflix adaptation was a fun little watch. 

It was not perfect. I feel like for the six episodes we are given, it was rushed in some parts and drug in others. 
On paper all the characters ideally seem good but on the flip side there are so many characters with so few episodes that it doesn’t give time for you to get to know and develop them. Which results in a lot of TELLING and not showing. 

The visuals and the fight scenes are amazing. The political twists and turns that happen keep you guessing. I definitely never was bored.  

 I will say while rushes at times, it is a good balance in respecting the anime it is based off of and being easy enough to digest for people knew to the world.  

Six episodes that go fairly quick, it’s a good watch and I hope if there is a season 2, we get a little more character building.

I love trying to figure out the movie afterwards, but more often than not there's NO clear info and I'm sick of ""oh, well let's leave it up to the audience to decide"" what actually happened.  

In Noise, you are confronted with a myriad of unresolved situations.   There's a point in the middle where it seems it could go any of several different directions...  ""The father is coherent and the son proves his story"" or ""the butcher lady had a deep role to play,"" or when the floorboards were bouncing there was something extra-magical at play.  

In the end the only reasonable explanation for anything is that all trippy scenes are Fake, the Grandfather's obsession is fake, despite his son taking up the cause, and that the solution to reaching 'Happily Ever After' is to take some pills.

Yesterday, I opened the Netflix app on my laptop, and on my Smart TV and nowhere did it ask me to add an additional member account, and it let me watch a bunch of stuff with no issues. 

Do I HAVE to make a second user account, or will it just add the extra member fee onto my parent's monthly bill? I have no problem to make the account, I'm just wondering why it let me open the app and watch stuff without any notification about a second location.

But everyone was hyping it up and I was expecting so much more.  

I think my main issue with the show is that it is trying to do so much with only seven episodes. 

If it focused more on Martha and her stalking, it would definitely have been more of a thriller. She really doesn’t do anything major aside from attacking Terri and Donny. 

His rape literally takes place over a span of one episode.  Again, I wanted to really know more about this trauma. That plot really deserves more than one episode but the portrayal (rushed as it was) is also the best episode of the season. 

Him coming to terms with his sexuality….again it felt rushed.  Teri is a beautiful woman so it makes it hard to relate or understand her character when she is gorgeous.  “She looks like a man” and clearly she doesn’t.  It’s like Sydney Sweeney acting as an “ugly character” when she clearly isn’t.  

More importantly, we really don’t get much to see their relationship develop besides him admitting to lying and their lack of sexual chemistry.  Teri is far less of an interesting character. 

He gave a beautiful monologue about his abuse and what it costs him. but instead of letting him fully confront Darrien. They just chat over tea and Donny accepts the job offer despite all the pain and despite him saying he was over it during his monologue.  

The ending with him parallel how he met Martha was perfect. 

The acting was superb but I just came out with a meh feeling. I feel like with a few more episodes or simply making the 7 longer episodes so much that felt rush (like his rape/drug addiction) would have landed better. ",168,11

How to read this. 28 days completion rate, then 90 days completion rate. The other colorized is the status of the series. Renew or cancelled. If a show is renew prior to the season air, then it has more to do with the strength of the season prior. Then there are limited series which meant to be one off. However, if a show really successful. I am sure they will find way to make it not limited. This is rank on the % of completion by the time period of 28 or 90 days.

.

Maybe Netflix does consider completion rate. But I think based on overall est. viewers (hours view/show runtime), budget consideration, and demographic. These three probably covered the completion rate. The two example people gave for their theory that completion rate are everything is 1989 and Heartstoppers. Heartstoppers had low viewership but got renewed for 2 seasons. This can be explain away by the target viewership LGBTQ+ are much smaller (probably less than 10% of the overall viewership). So they already expected this show to have lower viewership anyway. The budget is small, and it nice to have different properties that target different consumer base.

.

1899 is on the opposite end, had an okay viewership but got canceled. But what they don't tell you is that it was (and may still is) the most expensive German television show up to that point. 62 million dollars in 2018/2019. That is like about 71 mil around the time One Piece was shoot. About 8.9 mil per ep if shoot in 2022. That is expensive. For that price, the viewership is not good enough.

.

As you can see when I rank all the available data, shows that have so low completion rate like Dark, Fubar, and Sandman have renewal. While shows like Sex/Life, Firefly Lane, Shadow and Bones got canceled. Even Manifest had dropped its viewership so much that it is about time for it to finished, despite the high completion rate. 

.

Why it doesn't really matter to me. Nielsen is around for like a 100 years. I trust them. I trust Netflix with their very own data. While most of these completion rate data came from Plum Research. And I don't know what is their methodology. Do they have special access to Netflix data? They said they have global reach. But I don't have the confident until I see a lot more from them. Especially since some show like Squid Game is more about global performance.  On Nielsen Squid Game had half of Wednesday's viewer in the US.  While Netflix global data, Squid Game actually beat Wednesday.  Larger views are still good. If only 10 people what your show with a 90% completion rate, that would be like 9 people. But if a 100 people watch your show with a 50% completion rate, that is like 50 people.

.

Then there is the data. It is incomplete data. Meaning if you don't have all of the data, you cannot draw correlation, or a trend line that easy. If they gave me two data points that is 1899 and Heartstoppers. Then I guess the hypothesis of completion rate sound very good. But then even with all the partial data I got from them, it doesn't draw that conclusion. Like would the status of renewal series better explain with the overall viewership, and with the consideration of the target goal (budget/target demographic). I see one article said it. Then articles echo each others. Then people on forums/reddits echoed each others. They assume it has to do with completion rate (in some articles) while don't have the data for it. Unlike with Nielsen and Netflix top 10 have more extensive data.",2,0

After a lot of trial and error and frustrated talks with the customer service in an attempt to add 2 existing accounts as extra members I finally figured out how to do this without having to pay for new subscriptions. I’ll break it doen below.

The issue most people face is that if you want to add an extra member you dont actually get the option to transfer a profile if the new slow has already been purchased. If you then create a new account for the extra member this account is limited to only 1 profile which will be the default profile. The challenge was to create a new account with a transferred profile as the default. This is how I did it:


1. Change the email of the to-be-added account to a different email.

2. From this to-be-added account under the new email transfer the profile to a new account under the original email. This asks you to create a new account with password.

3. Once you did this the next thing Netflix asks is to finish transferring the profile. Choose Finish Later. Confirm you dont want to transfer the profile.
*Your account is now created in a state where the first thing it wants to do is finish transferring your profile*

4. Go to the main account holder with the ability to invite extra members. Invite the new account with the original email. 

5. Accept the invite (on a different device/browser or log out of the main account)

6. If everything worked you will be presented with a prompt to choose a name for your profile. This name should match the transferred profile.

7. Finish setup!


I just did this with 2 account and in both cases it worked flawlessly. It’s a shame Netflix makes this so difficult. There are definitely ways to make this easier.


I hope this helps anyone!",0,0

If your current show/movie switches to a black screen in preparation for running an ad but freezes, then try:

- Pause the video if the screen remains blank but the audio continues.
- Press play, then press pause, or pause, then play, then pause to ensure the video has stopped playing.
- Use the remote or app to “gently” and manually advance the video forward. Likely, there will be no visual indication that doing this is having any effect.
- “Gently” means only trying to advance the video forward slowly and only a few seconds. Trying to advance the video forward too rapidly or too far could have unpredictable results.
- At this point, the ad may “catch-up” and start to play as expected. Then you are good to go until the next ad hiccup. If it happens again, then repeat the process.

If the ad has not started to play and the screen is still black, then you have a few options:

   A) Try advancing the video a little bit more. Remember, there will be no indication that what you are trying to do is having any effect. Then press play. The ad or video may start to play.
   B) No luck? Press the back button to return to the previous screen where you can choose to “resume playing” or “play from the beginning”. Playing from the beginning may or may not fix the problem. Select ""resume playing"".
       - As soon as the video starts to play, then press pause. Try advancing the video forward past the “ad dot” and press play. This might work just fine or the issue continues. Repeat the process, try some variations, curse the ads, and trial-and-error the bug into submission.

Post your results and provide feedback.

1) Most of them start good, and never  end good.  
2) In some cases they never end because everyone else thought it's bad and you are part of those handfull waiting for the next episode 
3) there is no benefit to the producers to make  a series ending good, they just want to extend or stop depending on the financial aspects. Ending a serious at the right moment is never in their agenda 

So usually they tend to have  great first few seasons, then always downhill from there...

I like to see series with independent episodes or atleast independent seasons

So does it worth spending time with series like 3 body  problem... I loved it and is sure that it's never going to give a satisfactory ending after 400 (or 4)seasons

I just finished watching ""The Old Man"" series, and I have to say, I am obsessed!

 Jeff Bridges absolutely shines in his role, the storyline is intense, filled with unexpected twists and turns that kept me glued to the screen.

Without giving away any spoilers, I'll just say that if you're into gripping thrillers with a touch of mystery and a stellar cast, this series is definitely worth checking out. The pacing is perfect, never a dull moment, and the cinematography is top-notch.

Overall, ""The Old Man"" exceeded my expectations, and I'm already eagerly waiting for the next season. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for their next binge-worthy show!

Many people have praised Richard for his bravery and I completely agree. However one thing I haven’t seen anyone talk about is Martha’s story when she reveals why she always calls him baby reindeer. Which is because of her abusive family and her baby reindeer teddy is the only comfort she had. 

I’m very lucky and have grown up with loving parents who would do anything for me. So what does this have to do with sympathy for Martha?
My parents were also foster parents so I have experienced (to a small extent) both sides of the spectrum and have grew up with foster children and teenagers from poor and deprived backgrounds. So I have never personally experienced a poor family background but I have seen what it does and the impact it has on people and I have seen many personalities that stem from this too, some good like independence, some bad like extreme attachment disorder like Martha has. 

So the reason I feel for Martha to an extent and think baby reindeer hits a stroke of genius is because by telling her story at the end it shows that at first she comes across as a complete psycho, but then you understand why. 
She has actually had a terrible life, she just wanted the love and affection she never received as a child. she came from an abusive background with no one there for her, she lived on her own with no one to care for her throughout the whole series and had no one at all to help her. So when she did find someone who showed even the slightest sign of sympathy.. she clung onto them as it was all she had. 
Some of the things Martha did is completely wrong and inexcusable, but when he dug deep and discovered why in the voice messages and began to cry I think Donny realised himself... how alone and traumatised Martha was to the point she became mentally ill. 

Sometimes it’s help these people need, and if she wasn’t so traumatised by her abusive family she may never have been so troubled and have the attachment disorders she now has to live with.

netflix,t3_1cabdf3,1713793999.0,/r/netflix/comments/1cabdf3/resident_alien_was_a_huge_letdown/,t2_kjv00yp8q,,Resident Alien was a HUGE let-down.,"Just tried watching it this weekend. I had high hopes given that it starred Alan Tudyk as the alien and was written by Chris Sharidan. But my hopes soon died. Alan's actung is amazing as usual, but even he can't carry a show with such poor writing. 

He starts by committing cold-blooded murder. He then spends most of the first season trying to (and somehow failing to) murder a young boy who can see his true form. 

This kid can see this crazy looking alien that no one else can see who keeps saying he's going to dismember him or some other such grotesque thing, but instead of going mad, he ""gets over it"" and and starts giving sass to said alien. Then this super-intelligent alien spends several scenes having elementary school level arguments with this child.
Then there's the sheriff, a character so cartoonish I would expect to see him in a Monty-Python skit. 

The thing that finally does the show in is the overt neo-feminism. It was pretty bad in the first season, but went from eye-rolling quips about men to full blown rants in season two. 

The forementioned child that was apparently capable of standing his own against an alien in season one becomes an idiot to make room for a new child character, a middle-eastern girl of Islamic faith, who naturally has to lead the stupid while male child around by the nose. 

Every episode of season two seems to be a fable about how women suffer at the hands of men and all the crappy things men do. They even have an entire episode dedicated to the gender pay gap myth. That's in-between all the girl-power dance montages.

The last straw for me was when Harry laments about a woman's male boss being overtly innapropriate towards her. (Becsuse of course he is, he's a man isn't he) and Asta starts yelling at him and lecturing him. Telling him that the next time a woman has something to say, he needs to sit down and shut up! I decided I had had enough and found something better to watch.

It's truly sad that someone that wrote for Family Guy for over 10 years could be reduced to this. ",58,0

Correct me if I’m wrong, but from some posts and comments i’ve read about the show, I’ve gathered that the theory of everything being in his head is implying that he’s taking other events around him that are actually happening in what would be considered our reality , (in the way that it’s how these things would happen in actual real life) and turning them into the events as we see them play out, or maybe even just filling in blanks. And yes i know the director of the show himself said it was all in his head as well, but there’s just too much in the show that happened for me to just believe some instagram comment tbh, no matter who said it. Anyways, i have plenty of questions about this theory :

What could’ve been actually going on when his eyesight gets better, gets worse when his powers were taken, then gets better again when they return? Eyesight doesn’t just randomly improve on its own like that, let alone deteriorate and then improve yet again on top of that. 

Why would he blame the Jotuls for Isolde’s death? The first time he sees Saxa and Fjor, they’re just the overly attractive, rich popular kids. With Ran, she’s just a principal/English teacher. With Vidar, he was just some guy that his mom knew in the past. Why would he see them as mortal enemies that killed the girl he liked? He has no other interactions that go beyond those initial impressions until after Isolde dies. Why would he imagine Vidar ripping out goat hearts, eating them and snapping Isolde’s neck? Why would he imagine them as Giants? 

How did he imagine generations of family pictures where the Jotuls look completely the same over the years when other people like Gry had seen them, held them and even acknowledged the pictures as such as well? If they weren’t immortal Giants, why would Vidar feel the need to demand Fjor kill Gry for seeing and keeping one of the photos? What other possible secret could that photo or any of them have possibly held that required death if revealed?

What could have been going on that led Vidar to being at Magne’s house during Isolde’s funeral? I know the homeless guy was also there, but he admitted to what he took and agreed to return it. There was no reason to add on that someone else had been there. If Vidar was never there, why would Ran feel the need to press him about it? Why wouldn’t he simply say what he was actually doing instead of just listening to her accusations and the implications of those actions with a guilty look on his face? She said herself that he wasn’t at the funeral, what else would he had been doing?

What was actually going on when Magne got stronger and faster? He threw a hammer from his house all the way to Jotulheim. What could explain that in actuality? There’s pictures that others have seen of the result. What could have actually been going on when he was running at unreal speeds and actually recording them on his phone? Or when he was throwing hammers and measuring how far they went? Or when he gets ran over by a whole plow truck and coming out of it completely unscathed? Multiple people saw him get run over, and multiple doctors, nurses, and X-rays confirmed he was perfectly fine afterwards. Why would he be strong enough to snap a huge, strong dog’s jaw in half and also come out of that unscathed as well, despite being bitten and scratched during the fight? What was actually going on when him and Ran had an arm wrestling match and broke an entire table in half? How did he bend an entire steel bat in half in front of his brother? And what about when Laurits stabbed himself completely through his hand to where you saw the object come out the other side and he instantly healed? What could’ve been happening in that moment?

How could the weather always change at the exact moment when he’s mad if he’s imagining this stuff? Why did the lights ONLY conveniently flicker when he was pissed off? Why would the town only lose power at those times as well? Why did it only thunder and lighting in these moments? These are weather changes people around him noticed and acknowledged as well. 

What about the fight scene with Vidar in season 1? What was happening that Magne was imagining himself getting thrown through multiple concrete (or whatever they’re made of) walls? When he summoned all that lightning that struck both him and Vidar at the same time? What was happening when the paramedic helper went flying 5 meters away (as stated by the other paramedic) from Magne after trying to use the defibrillator? 

What could’ve been actually going on when Magne was watching Iman use the powers of persuasion to get what she wanted out of people? How did Harry all of a sudden go from some mechanic in a shop in a small town to being a nationally renowned and loved Olympic athlete in his late 20s - early 30s (he looks around that age range at least) without any training? What could any of the “Gods” have actually been talking about at all when making plans, talking about their powers, etc that Magne would misconstrue it into what we see and hear on the show? In fact, what about the conversations about these same things with the Jotuls as well? And the Old Norse they spoke with?

If not for the reasons we see on the show, why would the Jotuls feel the need to kill the lady from the grocery store? What could some old cashier have possible done to upset them that much? And she obviously did very much die, imagining or not, as we don’t see her for the rest of the show and Turid takes her place at the store. 

What was Magne actually doing in Jotulheim if he wasn’t trying to forge Mjolnir in what he thought was the eternal flame? What was going on when they actually did forge the real Mjolnir in the factory?

Why would Laurits want to drink Wotans blood if he didn’t believe he was becoming half God? If he wasn’t drinking blood, then what was he drinking and why?

If Vidar died from a heart attack, why was his funeral closed casket? His body wouldn’t have been disfigured, mutilated, missing, or anything in that case. What was Magne actually doing in that moment if not killing Vidar? What could Magne and Fjor actually be talking about when he was admitting to killing Vidar?

If the tapeworm wasn’t the Midgard Serpent, then what was it? Was Laurits just keeping a snake sized tapeworm in his room until he was made to get rid of it? Why was Fjor killing people and throwing them into the lake if not to feed the Serpent? What was Magne seeing and doing when he fought it, threw the hammer at it and lost it?

There’s even more stuff i could ask as well. His use of lightning and the hammer and the damage he caused to the environment and objects around him (ie destroying Fjor’s car, breaking that piece of the mountain off and cutting the power in town), why people around him were getting hurt or beaten up (i.e Laurits being beat up by the Jotuls), what was actually going through his mind and what was he really doing when he would’ve been imagining the hammer changing how he was acting, etc etc, but those of you who read this far, i think yall get the point. 

Maybe im taking the theory a little too literal because like i said, im under the assumption that he’s replacing stuff going on as it would occur in real life and is imagining the show we see. But i mean, that’s the only way this theory works, right? Unless he’s just laying in bed on his free time playing this stuff out in his head and is otherwise leading a normal life. 

I understand the director’s instagram comment, and i know Magne was diagnosed with schizophrenia (i think) but i mean come on, if some guy was walking around saying he’s freaking Thor, the God of Thunder with full belief, wouldn’t you think he’s a bit wacko too if you didn’t know what was actually going on?

So yeah, what do you all think of this? I just have too many questions to accept that it’s imaginary based on an IG comment and one scene in the show. ",13,5

Is anyone else annoyed by how much streaming service prices have skyrocketed over the last decade? When Netflix first launched, it was affordable and had an excellent selection of movies and series. Now, ten years later, the price for the standard plan has shot up by 62%. Moreover, to catch all the mainstream series, it feels like you need to subscribe to five different streaming services.

It seems streaming services initially undercut linear TV with unsustainably low prices, using cheap money to driving out competition - a tactic aimed at monopolizing the market. Now that they've weakened their competitors, the real costs are starting to hit us. I've gone back to linear TV and their online libraries, which might not have everything but have decent series and documentaries andare often even free.

Has anyone else felt pushed back to traditional TV or found other cost-effective alternatives to manage the rising costs of streaming services? Apart from raising the black flag, of course?

It's one of those wannabe Game of Thrones shows that would have been HUGE if it had come out a few years prior, or if anyone intentionally watched Starz. Great cast, wonderful writing, compelling story. 

It's a prequel to Treasure Island, so it's got the origins of several characters from that book, as well as a ton of historical pirates, and does a fun job of fleshing them out as they bounce off each other. 

Speaking of bouncing off each other, there's an awful lot of sex in it.  Like, they have a boob quota they take very seriously, and it's maybe a bit distracting to hear semi-Shakespearean dialogue between two characters as they aggressively plow, but it gives you something else to appreciate the actors for.

Since i had nothing better to do..I ended up binging the hell out of the four shows mentioned above &amp; here are my thoughts on each of'em:

1. Heartbreak High S2 - Not a fan of highschool shows but since i was tricked to watch S1 i had to watch S2. LOL.

Overall a solid pass. The shows does flounder a bit as far as character correction is concerned. Almost every character is on correction course for some reason (mostly love). Still liked it enough. No regrets - 7/10

2. Baby Reindeer

What a vivid watch!! Its Dark (er), disturbing, nerve-racking and everything else. Richard Gadd absolutely smashed it out of the park. The toxic relationship between Donny &amp; Martha is as fun to watch as a car crash. It is compellingly unforgetable. You will most likely end up shedding tears. A Hidden gem - 9/10

3. Parasyte - The grey

Starts of brilliantly. Excellent world-building at the start. However i think it suffered from pacing issue. The side characters seemed underdeveloped too. Could have been mich better - 6/10

4. Ripley 

I almost quit after first 20mins of the first episode. Couldn't take well to the monochrome screenplay initially. But i am so so damn glad i stuck around!!! Absolutely loved it!!!! Masterpiece really. From direction to actors..Top level stuff! 

Andrew Scott's best performance till date IMO. 

Stunningly shot, funny in a morbid way and perfect detailing of ambition and insecurities. Best of the lot for me - 10/10

I have never met a show that has made me more conflicted than ""The Glory"". On the one hand, it is well shot, the dialogue is great, the costume designer needs a raise, and the acting is incredible. The story though is where I separate the fun from the good. This show makes one fatal flaw that just ruined it so much for me- it made the unsympathetic villains the underdogs. In a show such as this, a show centered on revenge, the antagonists should be smart, calculating, and well-informed. Instead, the antagonists here are incredibly stupid and simply caricatures used to develop the protagonist- a static character. Never in this show, once, did I feel that Moon was in any sort of danger or would not win in the end, and that made the show work against itself. It also made the antagonists the underdogs because Moon was just so much more strategic, and as a sucker for underdogs, I had to remind myself that I cannot root for crazy evil psychopaths just because they're the underdogs. And that just made me hate the show even more. Sure, while the hijinks are fun and exciting, the predictability of the show and the lack of obstacles for the protagonist make me hate the characters with a passion. I am glad it did not repeat cliches about vengeance being destructive, even if it is, and just let a full revenge story play out; but the fact that the protagonist always had the advantage made it horrible. Death Note is great because Light and L are both equally intelligent and both win some and lose some in their battle, and both are incredibly smart and both trade upper hands throughout the show until Light eventually kills him (who is then later killed by his predecessors). Could you imagine if Light or L only one of them was smart and the other was a crazy stupid moron; it would be unwatchable. And that is where the glory went wrong.

One of the parents grew up there, I believe. One by one, their group of friends are killed off by a mysterious murderer. Most people in the town believe it to be an older man who lives by himself on the outskirts. *SPOILER* in the end, we find out that one couple in the friend group won the lottery, but the rest of them conspired to kill them for the money. They've kept this secret the entire time and were being killed off in an act of revenge by I can't remember who. I BELIEVE that it was in French.

Also, PLEASE, let's not bully her. Let's not extend the cycle of trauma. The whole point of the show is ""hurt people, hurt people"". She clearly doesn't have the resources to process and take care of the hurt. Where do you think that will go? She will obviously keep hurting more people as she goes along if we keep inflicting more pain.

Our brains release dopamine and adrenaline when we're scared, giving us that natural high that keeps us coming back for more. Plus, there's this weird sense of satisfaction when we conquer our fears by watching these movies.

My favorite genre are romcoms and I would be happy if the show lasted more than perhaps one season. You don’t have to recommended romcoms, but I obviously enjoy shows with romance and comedy a lot. 
 
To make it easier here’s a small list of shows I loved or enjoyed. 

Loved: Anne with an E, Modern Family, Bridgerton, The Legend of Korra, The Witcher, Never have I ever, Once upon a Time, 15 again, Percy Jackson

Liked: Gilmore Girls, Blood&amp;Water, Gossip Girl, Desperate Housewives, Superstore, Orange is the new Black, Ginny&amp;Georgia(too cringe though), Stranger Things, Skins, Insastiable, The summer I turned pretty 

Dropped: Riverdale - weird plot, Elite - too many unnecessary 18+ scenes, The vampire diaries - Got boring, Wednesday - too boring, Me and the Walter boys - too cringe

- The kiss in the maze. Like, let's be friends, you're getting engaged, but let's kiss a bit. Then, come on, I would like to meet your fiance. Not that kissing a friend is not allowed if the relationship evolves that way, if there is attraction and so on. But, my guess is that, if it happens, you talk about it. I liked the episode though, one of my favourites. 

- The night of graduation. I have a sort of hard time to believe that a guy like Dex would have so much patience when being kept at a distance and not actually having sex.

- In her last message she says 'I love you too'. Did I misunderstood or was it like she was saying it for the first time? Rather strange, after being close for so much time, having the wedding and so on. And saying 'Lucky you' I really didn't like.

- Their small conflict on their last day together seemed rather forced as well.

Also, the driver in the opening scene has short lighter colored hair, glasses, and a hat on. BUT his shoes match the ones Sparma wears throughout the movie.

everything that happens in the show seems entirely scripted, OR they preplanned the events of the show and it was all improv. i don't believe their stories are real, and i have my doubts that some of the parents were even their parents irl, but my bad if they are. i even felt like deandra may have been an english person faking a new york accent, i really did. and solomon as a whole cannot be real i refuse to believe it

it was a really funny show and i was interested in everyone's stories, but it was more similar to a mockumentary than a reality show, and that threw me off.

lastly, i feel like if it wasn't fake, they would have used a point system to determine the winner, or would do something like glow up, where they pick winners each challenge and give the losers a disadvantage somehow for the next challenge. or something like wipe out where people get knocked out and have to go home. which would be more complicated to plan and fake.

I don't want to get into the weeds on dialog, plot, or acting, just the story idea. I liked how they created their own story and didn't attempt to rewrite the anime. The special effects captured the idea of how the parasytes moved/split, and it seemed to fit inside the original world.

So much background, so much about what happened during the four years Jennifer was pretending to be in school, so much about previous trouble she was in. And no solid background on the family -- there wasn't even any mention of Jennifer having an older brother! Watching it, I completely thought she was an only child. And they had ONE photo of her parents that they just kept showing the whole time. ONE PHOTO. Did no other photos of these people exist anywhere? What cheap, worthless crap and a waste of my time.

Better off watching YouTube docs than NFLX docs pretty much 100% of the time these days. Apparently there is a bunch of info on YouTube about the Jennifer Pan case. So why does Netflix bother with half-assed, shitty docs like this?

I keep seeing articles from major trades, like Hollywood Reporter and others say this film is likely to be a big awards contender. But have they started filming this movie?

The last report I saw from this movie is they were looking to cast extras in Macon, GA for some shooting, but that was back in December or early January. And if this is meant to be an awards film, they’d have to release it this year, otherwise wait for 2025 and the following 2026 award season. I can’t imagine this movie would take long to shoot, especially considering most of the cast are the same from the Broadway production, so they had 5 months of perfecting that craft.

Anyway, if anyone can give me an update on if this has started shooting or not, I’d appreciate it.",3,1

And Auggie was still surprised that the construction they and especially she herself built killed everyone. What was your intention in the first place? You developed the technology. And in the next episode she was annoyingly sad about the trap she built by herself. It was all just annoying.

Let alone the idea of destroying everything in the boat to find ""something something data"" of which nobody knew how it was stored. 
Also, they destroyed a ship in one of the worlds most busy canals and they can search the wreck without anyone being concerned.

Also, again, they killed everyone on that ship after trying not to end it in a bloodbath. 

Did i miss a specific plot that explains it?

Also, I can't stand the actress of Auggie. The artificial lips, cheeks and nose are driving me crazy but sadly everyone praises her for her beauty ",298,172

I found it very interesting that they would often show the ""Kristina Tyneham"" photo after showing another character in the film.  The character is a woman who works in the palace with Amanda Thirsk.  They would often show Sam McAlister taking a long look at that character and then show the ""Kristina Tyneham"" photo.  I was wondering if it meant to imply that Sam thought it was the same person.

The atmosphere of the show shows the tension of both sides and how desperate each side are for every small victory. They made some changes to the original story but that is to be expected when something is getting adapted for a show. With all that said, the show isn't without its faults. All the battle scenes were a little underwhelming and felt short and Achilles  doesn't have a big presence in the show, actually none of the greek heroes do aside from Odysseus

I'm looking for a series with some side plot ( not main plot ) for, if possible, secondary characters ( not main character ) where there is betrayal ( not cheating ).

I recently watched a show ( not American, neither popular, so no need to mention it, but if by any chance a Tunisian is here, it's Nouba ) where a woman, working as double agent, used a good man to get a mission done, she protected him and didn't hurt him directly but the fact that he got used broke him and they had a beautiful scene where he genuinely tells her that he loves her and cries and asks why she chose him and she begs for forgiveness and tells him that she also loves him, but he leaves her, both crying and breaking.

They get dramatic scenes in next season, where he was supposed to be dead, but when she finds out he is alive, she is extremely happy to the point that she cries of joy in secret, but they don't get together right away, as he still didn't recover from what she did to her and even though she acts tough, she breaks into tears from joy that he is still alive.

Now this double agent is not really original but what I liked about this show is that :

* It's the woman that is the double agent and ended up using the man ( usually it's other way around )
* They are both regular people, she is a competent, yet vulnerable police officer, and the guy is not just a nice guy. He is a very good man, not a criminal, just close to the people who are criminals, who ended up liking her and wasn't crafty enough to see her betrayal coming and kept believing in her.
* It's kind of a slow burn. Their relationship was built slowly, from them getting to know each other, to the betrayal, to the encounter again, to the getting back together. Nothing is rushed

Another example for anyone who knows the KDrama Mouse: it's a different kind of betrayal, where the woman hid from the main character that his target, the son of a criminal he wants to avenge, is her boyfriend. When he knows, it gets ugly and dramatic and again, it's taken slowly.

Any recommendations ?

This post relates to UK Standard With Ads plan. I'm sorry if I missed it I couldn't see a tag / flair for UK

Just wondering if this issue is only happening with me - whenever I receive an advert, after my movie or show resumes, the quality is so shockingly bad, like pixelated. I know the easiest thing would be to return to the Netflix home screen and resume the movie / show, but whenever I do that, I seemingly hit another advert a few seconds in and then the same issue happens

Is anyone aware of any fixes for this?

Netflix support couldn't help me as the issue still exists after going through troubleshooting steps which is why I'm asking here. Their only solution was to upgrade to an ad-free plan but I don't want to pay more than £4.99 per month, my current financial situation isn't really welcoming that right now

Ok. So I just finished watching this Italian movie….my goodness. But there was one part I was confused and am looking for someone to enlighten me on what exactly the purpose of it was. So she wears bandages on her fingers throughout the film; until the end of the court hearing against that bitch Margaret. She then races out of the courthouse ripping the bandages off her fingers in the process. Can someone explain the bandages to me? Why does she wear them? I could see the symbolism of her being free from her abuser being represented by the bandages.

The format can have Its benefits and expend upon the murder sequences for instance, giving a more realistic perspective to Tom's modus operandi and how he covered his tracks. But It's not always working in favor of the suspense nor the viewers attention span.

To begin with, the Netflix show had a few subplots that felt like filler (The mafia guy, the bank fraud or the cat who left blood stains on the stairs...just to name a few). Though the long episodes did expend in details the key moments of the story...they had a tendency to drag the pace. The investigation parts had a good rythme at first but became tedious and repetitive. In contrast, the 1999 adaptation condensed the plot brilliantly in 2 hours, keeping the tension tight from beginning to end.

Character arcs have been slightly improved with Tom, Marge or the inspector but butchered with Freddy. For instance, Tom's jealousy with Freddy/Dickie's friendship is absent here, which resulted in a watered down confrontation later on imo. Speaking of Freddy, there were some odd casting choices: Eliot Sumner... wasn't great. They appeared as menacing as a banana peel in the sand. Dakota Fanning as Marge was dull and apathetic. Andrew Scott's Tom could be captivating at times but one note in his delivery ( he's also too old to play a convincing character in his 30's).

The dynamic between the cast was off, they lacked chemistry on screen. Marge, Dickie and Freddy felt like people who barely knew each other. Overall the performances were a mix bag, the actors probably needed better direction or a few more takes.

On the positive side I liked how the show mirrored Caravaggio's life with Tom's, the symbolism and references to classical painting. It's very well shot, the monochromatic palette and set designs were commendable and effective in conveying the 60's aesthetic. It felt expensive and the Hitchcockian vibes were spot-on. I liked how the show did Its own thing and portrayed Tom's cunning and deceiving personality in a more sinister approach.

For me, the biggest difficulty Ripley has is to co-exist with the other adaptations and that's partly how It failed to keep the formula interesting, especially when the aura of the 1999 version remains so vibrant and overshadowing in every way. It's a good addition to the Netflix catalog but unfortunately not as spellbinding as some may say.

*On a side note, I missed my favourite character Peter, even though I knew he wouldn't appear here since he's not in the book. 

What did you guys think of the show? ",47,29

I love the original anime to death, it's probably in my top three favorite shows of all time and this live action really nails it. 

First of all, if you've seen the anime, don't go into this one expecting a retelling of Shinichi and Migi's story. While this adaptation has a lot of the same themes and general story beats, it's far from a 1 to 1 remake, nor does it try to be. Instead, it's showing us what happened in South Korea at roughly the same time as the original show. It still has a lot of the same themes and existential questions about humanity that were so prevalent and enticing in the anime. If you are unaware of the anime at all, the basic premise is that alien parasites come to earth and start body snatching humans. They destroy the original human consciousness when doing so. The main character is only partially infected by his parasite and so they have to work together for their mutual survival. This show has a similar thing going on, though the main character is infected with her parasite in a different way in the anime (it was in his hand there.)

The characters are all a lot of fun. The main detective dude is my favorite and the crazy lady who leads the Grays is both hilarious and terrifying. Sorry I'm horrible with names. Su-in, the main character is also really good. Her story is heartbreaking and you really feel for her throughout the show. The actress playing her does a great job playing her roles (you'll see what I mean.) 

The CGI though is really where this show shines. If you are a fan of horror, particularly body horror, this show fucking hits the beats. The way the parasytes move and warp their host is horrific and unsettling. There's one scene on a bridge, and I won't spoil too much but it seriously highlights how terrifying these things actually are. There's gore and it's really well done imo. It's not gory for the sake of gory, more realistic I guess I would say. 

I've been watching the dubbed version which is serviceable, but its probably better in the original audio. The original show asks a lot of questions about humanity and it's impact on this Earth. It does a great job at asking you to reflect on your place in the world and how you treat the environment and people around you. I think this adaptation really translates that well. Forreal y'all, check this one out. It's pretty darn good. ",136,292

Spoilers abound, so watch the films first

After being captivated by the first part, the sequel left me less than convinced. I had so many questions, just like you. After a deep dive into Reddit and the internet, **I discovered THE 2 KEY DETAILS YOU NEED TO KNOW:**

1. Verta and Blanca ARE NOT SIBLINGS!
2. Green Snake's Xuan and White Snake's Xuan are not same (because he's a reincarnation)

**So why did Verta and Blanca keep calling each other sisters?**

* They refer to each other as 'sister' because they served the same master / to show affection / possibly due to a cultural norm among Chinese people etc.
* Whatever the reason may be, they are not siblings.
* Therefore, there's no need to be bothered by any implied 'incestuous vibes' from the films, as this was a deliberate choice.

**The 1st part (White Snake) subtly hinted at Verta's love for Blanca.**

* The pool scene at the beginning was freaking hot. Verta's affection for Blanca was clearly evident (but not vice versa).
* Rewatch the scene where Verta angrily confesses (to Blanca) that she's taken the Scorching Death Scales for her. You'll observe Verta's efforts to get extremely close to Blanca, adding a unique layer to their relationship.

**In Part 2 (Greek Snake) -**

* They made it more obvious because the lead is Verta not Blanca.
* I don't think you need any hints here beause it was so apparent!

**This is why we all got those ""incestuous vibes""**

* I used to feel strange for wanting them to make out in the 1st part itself (despite assuming they were siblings).
* But it turns out, the creators did want the audience to invoke that feeling.

**So why did the makers make Verta and Blanca love story so complicated?**

* Why was Blanca reincarnated as a male instead of female? Why were there no kissing scenes between them?
* That's because of Chinese Censorship!
* Blanca wasn't reincarnated as female due to Chinese censorship regarding homosexuality
* As for the absence of kissing scenes in 'Green Snake,' the ending reveals that the male character was actually Blanca, and then the Censor board isn't stupid to overlook that the makers just tried to outsmart them by adding kissing scene between male Blanca and Verta (which is nothing but implied homo!)
* (But I so badly wish they did make out)

**Why did the makers do Xuan so dirty in the sequel ?**

* I suppose this is where they make it clear to the audience that THIS LOVE STORY IS ABOUT VERTA AND BLANCA ( not Blanca and Xuan ).
* Green Snake's Xuan is not the original Xuan; he's a reincarnation.
* As a result, Green Snake's Xuan doesn't love Blanca like White Snake's Xuan did.
* This is why he's depicted as weak and incapable of caring for Blanca; he doesn't love her like our original Xuan did.

**The major highlights of the 2 films are -**

* Verta is deeply in love with Blanca from the beginning.
* Blanca is in love with Xuan (at least until the first part).
* Green Snake's Xuan and White Snake's Xuan are different.
* Green Snake's Xuan doesn't love Blanca that much.
* Blanca eventually realizes the value of Verta's love in the second part.

**Even with all this understanding, I still have issues with the Part 2(Green Snake)**

* The first part had me completely hooked, especially the Blanca and Xuan love story
* It left such a strong impression that no matter how much Verta evolves, I can't see Blanca with someone else (unless Xuan dies, which he doesn't!)
* I still feel that they didn't do justice to Xuan.
* The characters in the sequel were forgettable, the plot was dull.
* Aside from the ending, the sequel lacked a powerful impact.
* The antagonists in White Snake were so compelling (all of them), while the Monk and that weird demon in the sequel didn't feel as strong

**Top Concerns for the 3rd Part -**

* How will they develop Verta and Blanca's love story without violating Chinese censorship?
* Most likely, White Snake 3 will also avoid any romantic scenes between the two, which is disappointing!

**Ultimate Tip -**

* Before recommending these films, make sure to mention that Verta and Blanca are not siblings; it's not a spoiler. This single detail will entirely change how they perceive the story(eliminating any suggestion of incest).

I was soon after recommended Mindhunter and have tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. I trudged through episode 1 and kept looking to see how much longer the episode was. I then moved on to episode 2 and have been stuck there for the past week. 

I’m just wondering if it’s just me or if the acting and writing in this series is just truly awful. The thing is that the actors themselves are not bad actors, but the lines, timing and delivery seem off. Even when they’re trying to be funny the punch line is ruined by the delivery and the fact that the humor doesn’t fit in with the atmosphere or plot. I just wish I knew what they were trying to do here. Why does it have such great ratings on IMDb? Usually I can get on board with things rated 6 stars or higher but this is a no from me. Even the soundtrack choices feel completely out of place. I don’t know. I tried. I’ll be moving on to something else. Rant over. :)",10,0

For good reason. Personally, I thought they compressed the story and dumbed it down a bit too much. Still a great watch.

The books are amazing, I'd highly recommend them to anyone who liked the story, likes to read, or likes scifi.

Tencent made a Chinese version of the show before Netflix that is now on Amazon Prime (in US at least) and on Youtube. Its completely different in tone from the Netflix show - there are 30, yes 30, episodes that only cover the 1st book.

It is literally filming pretty much every scene in the book, with the book dialog. Very different from Hollywood adaptations, there are no changes to make it fit for tv audiences. I loved it. Some people complain its too slow. It gives you time to develop the story and characters and its interesting how different it feels and gives an insight into China.

I wonder when Netflix/Tencent will release the next seasons. Has Netflix even renewed it?

I was really satisfied to know that Howard Pilmar’s killers were served justice and read as much into the case as I could online. As I read more, what really struck me was the fact that Howard and Ros son, Phillip, purposely did not want to be reunited with his grandfather (someone that was very active in his childhood) and advocated for his mother and uncle to be free. Why in the world would Phillip Pilmar, knowing what his mom and uncle did to his dad, fight for their freedom and continue to avoid his own grandfather after all these years? Then I thought about something wild.

What if Howard (may he rest in peace) and his father were the evil ones in this case? Howard and his father were extremely close. In the documentary, Howard’s father stated that Ros was Howard’s first everything. Ros was also apparently $160,000 in debt to her previous job. It’s stated that she hid this debt from her husband.. but you’re telling me, Howard Pilmar, the son of a business mogul, was completely unaware of his wife’s finances and past? His father was also unaware? Then she owes the government another $14,000 (unpaid taxes related to running one of Howard’s coffee bars btw) and the bill collectors were calling the Pilmar’s home nonstop in the days leading up to Howard’s murder. According to a NY Times article, “Mr. Pilmar had contacted a divorce lawyer and was looking for a way out of the marriage … Witnesses said Mrs. Pilmar had complained about her husband, calling him verbally abusive. And one staff member even recalls Howard calling his wife a c*nt among many other names.” 

In the Netflix episode, one of the employees stated that  Howard’s office was making $1,000,000 per month back in 1996… but they couldn’t pay off Ros’s debts? Something is fishy to me. The documentary said that their marriage was falling apart. Howard was known to be a flirt, but nothing more than that according to his women acquaintances.  Imagine a situation where Ros is very unhappy in the marriage, feeling abused and acting out. Howard and his father not only refuse to help her with her debts, but also threaten to separate her from their child Phillip and file for divorce, leaving her with nothing if she tries to do anything. Evan Wald, Ros’s brother, even stated that he would kill Howard if he ever hurt his sister in any way. This all seems like full motive for Ros to kill Howard (with the help of her brother) , take the money and Phillip and get as far away from Howard’s family as she can. She explained everything to Phillip as he grew up and now he wants no contact with his dad’s side of the family, only justice for his mom and uncle. 

Of course, all of this is speculation, but these circumstances crossed my mind. What do you all think?

There were some earlier moments in episode 1 that gave me the ick, like her interrupting others to talk more about herself, but I let it slide because I was genuinely interested in the program. I made it through episode 2 and the way she was sending emails to her dad was so cringe. The meeting with her dad was the final drop in the bucket for me. It felt very performative, like she’s expecting to be praised by the internet for instantly filming and putting him on the spot like that. I don’t think there is anything the dad could have said or done that would satisfy her. She explains how parents are victims of the manipulation too, yet she holds such a grudge on her dad



Katherine is definitely a flawed person. She seems very unreasonable, vindictive, a little narcissistic, and dangerously obsessed about something that happened to her 20 years ago. It feels like she’s blaming everything that went wrong in her life on her dad and this 15 month period. I think the way she is dealing with her trauma is very unhealthy and stopping her from personal growth. The documentary has some other issues too, I don’t think I will make it through episode 3.

Spoiler warning.

&amp;#x200B;

I got hooked on the series. I liked it a lot and I want to continue watching it but I feel that in episode 6 (Helios 685) there are some big holes in the script.

1. They show that in the facility where they are going to fire the laser, there is a toxic leak, and they must inject an anti-toxin if you don't die. But when the military arrives they did not have the anti-toxin and nothing happens to them. (Even the soldier who was already in the facility dies immediately) So what happened here?

2. They say that by protocol they cannot kill. But throughout the series we see that if they kill if something interferes with the mission. However, in this crucial mission, those who protect the facility do not shoot to kill. Strange

3. When the plan is about to be ruined since the military manages to enter and prevent the laser from being activated. (again the theme of killing). They are replacing people one by one. Considering that they are acting according to what happens in the future. Did you really notice that sending a single person was not effective and you are sending one at a time? really?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still hooked on the series and will continue watching it, but I'm worried about these types of script holes. What do you think, are they holes in the script? Do they still happen in the other seasons?",0,1

There are 3 teams each with a woman. None of the women in any of the teams didn’t get eliminated in the first round or even come close  to not getting eliminated 

Then I think back to the previous episodes 

Ep1 running.
Even the fastest girls rank 47 and 48 place(only 2 in the top 50) 

Ep4 maze quest 
We can clearly see 1 man can out carry, out run and out fill the bucket vs a woman 

Ep6 mine quest

This was by far one of the worse 
1 girl vs girl vs 1 guy pushing the filled buckets of sand to the destination. No surprised the guy won 

On the team event. There was a team with a guy and a girl. Girl only managed to pushed 5 bags leaving the rest of the 45 bags to the guy. If guy were to team with literally any other guy, I think he could have won 

Next monkey bar event. Girl didn’t even finished the event 

Ep2 arena 1 vs 1 combat. This was the only episode whereby 1 of the women beat a guy by grabbing hold of the ball for 5 mins 

1. Do they really think they can beat the men when it comes to physical? 

2. If you are a team leader, would you pick a woman as a teammate?

after fluffy popped up a bunch on my youtube feed i decided to get netflix just to watch mr. iglesias after i think 3ish years? and now that im sitting on a cliffhanger again im starting to get more and more annoyed that it was cancelled and never continued even tho the marketing for the show was nonexistent? like i found it originally thru a tiktok edit and no other content on it (even when i watched more tiktok content on it as a fan) and now that im rewatching it the advertising still seems weak to me, even the reason of cancellation and maybe this is just coming from me being petty but no chance that this show was done this dirty for what it was. im 17 years old now and im still emotionally attached to this show (probably just childish but it's something im really attached to, the characters are nicely well rounded, there was a story that was leading to graduation where the show was seemingly SUPPOSED to end.)  


so the real rant:   
mr. iglesias was a pretty good show but overall the part it was cancelled at was really depressing considering relationship building was building along with the age of the students and year (junior at the cut off of the show). just really unfortunate that the show ended there after like yeah there are still dumb things in the show like the laugh track being a bit excessive but it had a good base, no 10/10, but not something to look back on. the students had a good and clean relationship build up, the teachers had a nice thing going on, the chemistry was building over time, but it just cancelled with no return. really sad to me that this  show got booted off, fluffy had an amazing portrayal and the message that good teachers were someone to talk to and have a good relationship was interesting for me, i figured that i'd try talking to my teachers more often and i became hella close with my freshman year math teacher (me being a senior now) and i talk to her as if she's a good friend, she's my best friend when it comes for college questions blah blah blah. The point is that i miss this show, needed somewhere to rant about this show being gone and reliving the pain that it's still gone.

""What do you guys actually look like?"" And I got so excited to see and then the sexy humanoid was like ""This suits your vision better"" like nah, I wanna see the aliens for fucksake.

Why is every show or movie based on the premise of humans finding aliens that we never get to see the damn aliens unless it's some crazy action movie or comedy? Contact did this too. All that buildup and the alien was her dad and we got like 3 seconds of it. 

I want a show where like we actually see what it's like if aliens land on earth, we see what the fuckers look like, and then watch humanity adapt like goddamn. At this point I'm banking on seing actual aliens before I see some movie or TV show aliens.",2,0
